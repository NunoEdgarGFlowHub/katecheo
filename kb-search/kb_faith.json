        "body": "Do you ever worry that the dreams and desires in your heart might never come to pass?\u00a0Do you sometimes feel sad because your life doesn\u2019t look the way you hoped it would?\u00a0Do you think about dreams you\u2019ve held in your heart since you were young and question if they were just fantasies?I do. I often wonder if I was just young and na\u00efve when I dreamed up the things in my heart, and maybe I should just forget about them, or do things my own way. I don\u2019t always have these doubts, but right now I am walking through a season where the fulfillment of my dreams seems so far away.**_I am questioning whether God really wants to give me the desires of my heart.\u00a0So this blog is being written from a messy place in my own life._**\u00a0I don\u2019t have all the answers, but hopefully that makes it more real and encourages you if you too are in a messy space.\u00a0If you aren\u2019t in this space right now, I encourage you to keep reading because you probably know someone that is walking through a waiting period, and you could be a voice of hope and encouragement to them.As a 27-year-old Christian woman, I am wrestling with a strong desire to meet my future husband. I have dated, and I have had my share of boyfriends and dates. Accompanied by plenty of heartache and disappointments. There\u2019s always been at least one guy on the scene in my life in some capacity \u2013 until now.Right now, there\u2019s no-one. There\u2019s no boyfriend. There\u2019s no guy interested or pursuing. There\u2019s literally no one, and I feel quite alone. It\u2019s a scary place to be in when all I\u2019ve known is the companionship and security of males. It\u2019s been a type of security blanket for me. After so much disappointment and brokenness, I am questioning whether God really does have the right man for me.## What about you? What are you walking through right now? What unfulfilled desires are in your heart?I can\u2019t help but think about the story of Abram and Sarai in the Bible. They strongly desired to have children. But it wasn\u2019t a simple straightforward journey for them. There was a lot of waiting.\u00a0If you don\u2019t know the story, I\u2019ll give you a very short version. God made a covenant (promise) with Abram that he would have offspring, and not just one or two, but many._And he brought him outside and said, \u201cLook toward heaven, and the number of stars, if you are able to number them.\u201d Then he said to him, \u201cSo shall your offspring be.\u201d And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.\u00a0_[Genesis 15:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15%3A4-5&version=NIV)It says that Abram believed the Lord, however in the very next chapter we see Abram\u2019s wife Sarai, suggesting that Abram take their slave Hagar and have a child with her. Why did Sarai do this? Because she was very old, and would have assumed that she was too old to have the child herself. Sarai\u2019s suggestion to have a child with Hagar wasn\u2019t a faith-based decision. It was driven by doubt and unbelief. Abram and Sarai didn\u2019t seek the Lord about it.## They used their own logic and forgot about how powerful God is.We do this too don\u2019t we? We have desires in our heart, and if they don\u2019t seem to be happening, or look impossible, we think of ways we can bring them to pass in our own strength, rather than God\u2019s.The moment doubt creeps in we forget how powerful God is and that He created the Universe by His command. I think we also forget how\u00a0_loving_ God is.Isn\u2019t this where our fear comes from,\u00a0_really_? Not that we doubt whether God CAN or CAN\u2019T do something, but whether He\u00a0_wants_\u00a0to?\u00a0For me, this is the real root of my fears. It\u2019s that somehow I feel God doesn\u2019t care about my desires, or that He\u2019s forgotten about all my prayers.I am reminded of the scripture in\u00a0[1 John 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A18&version=NIV):\u00a0_\u201cThere is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.\u201d_It\u2019s God\u2019s love that puts our fears to rest. Remembering His love. Dwelling and thinking about His love sends the fear away.When I struggle to really trust God\u2019s love for me\u00a0_personally_, I find great strength and encouragement from the promise in\u00a0[Romans 8:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A32&version=NIV)\u00a0which says,\u00a0_\u201cHe who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all \u2013 how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\u201d_**God did not spare Jesus, His very own Son.**\u00a0If he didn\u2019t spare Jesus, of course He will not spare us other good things.Going back to the story of Sarai of Abram now \u2013 the result of Abram having sexual relations with their slave Hagar, was a son named Ishmael. Abram was 86 when Ishmael was born. When Abram was 99, The Lord appeared to him again, 13 years after Ishmael was born, and renewed His covenant with him. It is at this point that his name is changed from Abram, to Abraham, which means \u2018father of a multitude.\u2019 The Lord also changed Sarai\u2019s name to Sarah, which means \u2018princess.\u2019 What amazing grace we see here! Even though Sarah and Abraham did things their own way and in their own strength, God didn\u2019t toss them aside. He came to Abraham again, changed his name, and renewed the promise He made to him.\u00a0This was despite Abraham and Sarah going about things their own way.**God did not give up on them.\u00a0**He renewed the covenant, and even despite more doubting (on Sarah\u2019s behalf) along the way,\u00a0_the promise was eventually fulfilled, and they gave birth to Isaac. Isaac was the fulfillment of their dream._#### What are you waiting on God for?I want to encourage you today not to give up.\u00a0**If you believe that the desire is God-given, don\u2019t give up waiting and trusting.**\u00a0And, if you feel that you may have messed things up, be encouraged by the story of Abraham and Sarah. They didn\u2019t do things perfectly either, but God\u2019s grace is bigger than any of our mistakes.My challenge is not uncommon.\u00a0**We all go through seasons of waiting on God.**And if you\u2019ve already walked through a difficult season of waiting and come out the other side, I encourage you to share your story with others.*This article is originally written by\u00a0Teagan Russell"

        "title": "Prepare to Share: Prayer",
        "body": "Prayer is the most common way we use to communicate with God.It\u2019s through prayer we praise and adore Him for who He is in our lives; a Father, Savior, Provider, Comforter, etc.It\u2019s through prayer we confess our sins and expose ourselves to Him for the actions we made.It\u2019s through prayer we verbally express our deepest gratitude to Him.And it\u2019s through prayer we ask for provisions and supplications not only for ourselves but for others as well.As Christians, we are to share and introduce Jesus to everyone. For it is written in Matthew 28:19\u00a0_\u201cGo therefore and\u00a0make disciples of\u00a0all nations,\u00a0baptizing them\u00a0in\u00a0the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d\u00a0_You can use prayer as a way for you to reach out to your family, friends \u2013anyone you know, really.**Prepare with Prayer**Before we proceed to the sharing part, we have to ask God for guidance, wisdom, and we also need to pray for the person we will be sharing to. \u00a0Find opportunities or ways on how you can pray for the person you want to reach out and simply ask them, \u201cHow can I pray for you?\u201dIt is always important to pray before we go to battle. Prayer shows humility and faithfulness in God\u2019s sovereignty. Letting God know that we need Him in every battle we face. That we cannot do it alone and we can never succeed in our own efforts. God will be the one who will equip us, prepare us, and provide for us the things we will be needing as we go on to our battles.**Partner with God Through Prayer**\u00a0Also consider asking God to guide you as you share the good news to the person. Ask for His wisdom that you may speak the right words with conviction and clarity. Ask the Holy Spirit to lead you in the process of sharing His word. \u00a0Ask God to speak to you and to speak through you. And pray that God will align your heart with His that your motives in sharing will be made right and pure.Include in your prayers that God will change the heart of the person and open his blinded eyes to the truth of the good news. Pray that God will humble his heart that he may surrender his life to Him and repent from his worldly desires. And also pray that he may encounter the love of God as he become aware of what He has done for them.**Persist in Prayer**Your prayer for the person doesn\u2019t stop there. Remember to check up on the person you are praying for about his concerns. Ask him how God is responding to him and his requests. Continue to pray for the person for it said that the best way to show your love for someone is to through praying for them.Pray that God will give the person a burden to get to know Him even more. A burden to be more intimate with his newfound relationship with God. That he will get to realize his need for God. Pray that God will move in every aspect of the person\u2019s life and that he will get to experience more of His love in it. Include in your prayers that God will help the person to completely surrender his life to Him as he journey in His new life with Him. And continue praying for the person\u2019s needs that he may witness God\u2019s blessings through God\u2019s response.\u00a0At the end of the day, it\u2019s still His will that should be and will be done. It\u2019s not ours but God\u2019s, for He knows what is best for all of us.I am reminded by Matthew 7:7-8 where Jesus said,\u00a0_\u201cAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\u201d_God makes all the difference so approach Him through prayer.Written by [Carlos Panganiban](http://ph.yesheis.com/en/blog/author/carlos-panganiban)"

        "title": "Prepare to Share: How to Love and Care for Others",
        "body": "As Christians, we are all called to be missionaries for Jesus. We are called for a mission to spread the good news to everyone\u2014family, friends, classmates, workmates, etc. It is written in Matthew 28:19:\u00a0_\u201cGo therefore and\u00a0make disciples of\u00a0**all**\u00a0nations,\u00a0baptizing them\u00a0in\u00a0the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d_Most of us are completely aware that we need to share Jesus to everyone. But majority struggle in sharing because they don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to open up the gospel to the person they\u2019ll be sharing to.Well, the best way for you to open up the gospel to the person is by simply showing care for the person. In this way, the person will be curious why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. This will make them wonder why all of a sudden you\u2019re being all kind and caring to them.Last time we talked about praying for the people whom we will be sharing the gospel to. In fact, the moment you asked the person what his or her prayer concerns are marks the beginning of caring for the person. So if you\u2019re reading this and you haven\u2019t asked the person what his/her prayer requests, why not start with that by simply asking the person how you can pray for him/her.Well there are countless ways for you to show your love and care for someone. One way is based on the person\u2019s\u00a0_Love Language \u2013_namely Words of Affirmation, Time, Touch, Acts of Service, and Gifts. Try and observe how the person responds to certain acts of love and cater to it!Below are a few ways on how you can show your love and care for the person:**Through Words - Send text messages**Sending encouraging text messages or Bible verses are one of the few ways you can show your love for the person. A simple \u201cyou can do it!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m praying for you\u00a0J\u201d can brighten up one\u2019s day.I remember when I sent my disciple an encouraging message on his exam day, he told me it really did brighten up his day and even motivated him to do his best on his exams. \u00a0Nowadays, we\u2019re on our phones almost 24/7 so it may be a simple no-brainer thing to us but for them it\u2019s more than that.**Through Time - Treat them out for coffee**Ask the person out for coffee, your treat! While some Filipinos who are naturally\u00a0_hiya,\u00a0_others can greatly appreciate the gesture. While drinking your hot caramel macchiato or sipping iced coffee, engage yourself with a meaningful conversation with him/her. Ask the person how his/her week has been, catching up with each other\u2019s life.I once invited a friend for coffee. We updated each other about how we were doing and she got to share some of her burdens with me. When we parted ways she told me how relieved and happy she was after sharing her problems with me. She felt like a heavy load was removed inside of her. This also gave me an opportunity to know how to pray for her.**Through Service - Visit them when they\u2019re sick**It\u2019s a joy when someone visits you when you\u2019re sick. This really means so much for the person you\u2019re visiting. To be stuck in bed for days is exhausting, boring, and sometimes depressing.If you know someone who is sick, go ahead and visit them. Help them out by offering to serve them or take care of them. This will help them recover soon, as it helps lessen the stress they\u2019re feeling.**Through Gifts \u2013 Personalize tokens**You can show your love and appreciation by giving the person gifts\u2014a simple letter, book, shirt, etc. You don\u2019t need to spend a fortune. Remember, you\u2019re not giving gifts to impress; you\u2019re giving gifts because you love the person and you want to show them how you appreciate them.A way to make it even more special is to personalize your gifts. It shows that you know your friend really well and they will surely be touched by the gesture.**Through Touch \u2013 The power of a high-five**The love language of touch is well\u2026 a touchy subject. That\u2019s why I recommend the simple gesture of a high-five. It\u2019s like a physical encouragement, a way to make others feel included. If the other person feels a little awkward, offering a high-five can signal that you\u2019re welcoming them.\u00a0These are just some of the ways you can show your love and care for the person. There\u2019s so many ways you can show your care for the person. Sometimes, because of the overflowing love you received from God, you tend to care for the person without even noticing it yourself.Small acts of kindness may be \u201csmall\u201d to you, but to the person you\u2019re extending it to, especially those who are really in need of those, will find it more than just something small but rather something even bigger and meaningful.As you continue showing care to others, they will, one day, wonder why you\u2019re doing those things. And if they ask you why, just simply tell them that you care for them, and you\u2019re just showing it in a tangible way. And maybe at that point, you can open up to them about the greatest love they can ever encounter, the love of God and how He showed it to us by sacrificing His Son for us.Written by [Carlos Panganiban](http://ph.yesheis.com/en/blog/author/carlos-panganiban)"

        "title": "Life Belt or Lifeboat",
        "body": "A mere two weeks ago I shared my faith with a complete stranger for the very first time. I\u2019ve conveyed the Good News amid friends and family, but I was convinced that telling an unfamiliar face of the saving grace of God in a matter of moments was downright awkward and not my forte.  It was Wednesday, which translates into \u201cbin-day\u201d in the suburb where I live. \u00a0On bin day our predominantly quiet neighbourhood is transformed into a hive of activity as streets fill with the underprivileged and destitute, searching through bins and bags hoping to find value in someone else\u2019s waste. The air bustle with a commotion of new sounds \u2013 from the echoing of bin lids flung open to the whining noise of small dogs howling, that evoke even the neighbourhood\u2019s most idle four-footed friend.On this Wednesday, in the midst of all the passing action, my doorbell rang. I opened the front door and could see a stranger lingering by the garden gate. I went to him, greeted and asked if I could help. He appeared needy, like the rest of the weathered wanderers outside, but instead of searching mere treasure, he was seeking work, and instead of purely picking up the residue he took the time to knock. His determination reminded me of\u00a0[Luke 11:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A8-10&version=NLT). From a small town, 42 kilometers away, he came looking for greener pastures. And as much as I wanted to help, I couldn\u2019t give him anything to do as the drought has taken care of both grass and weed.I don\u2019t recall the detail of how our conversation started, but in the few minutes that followed, this middle-aged man, husband and father of four shared his story of poverty and heartaches with me. He shared out of desperation, hoping to find an answer \u2013 and here I stood before him not knowing what to hand him. I have had conversations with quite a few other beggars before, each with their own explanation of circumstances and needs, but none of their stories have touched me like his. Most of the vagrants I\u2019ve encountered in the past were much more interested in the refuse than the rescue. His story was not much different than the rest, but I could somehow sense in this man a humble heart, a honest approach, a gentleness and a longing for hope. He was satisfied with a few tins of food and the R10 I had in my handbag that day and could have left, yet he continued to spill his sorrows \u2013 about his health, his children, his eldest son constantly in and out of prison. I could hear how much he loved his children in spite of it all.When I could no longer bear the fact that I had no more plasters for his bleeding heart, I asked him whether he believed in God. The question shook him, without a doubt. His answer was that he do believe God is there, pointing at the sky. As I encouraged him to pray for his son and for the rest of his family, he mentioned his random attempts to pray, but that he was unsure whether or not he prayed correctly. I could reassure him that it is not a matter of how we pray or what we say, as long as we open up our hearts before God and trust Him with our difficulties, anxieties and concerns, and then rest and wait on His provision.I remember thinking that he must have found my advice rather superficial and cosmetic. Here he is in all his brokenness, hopelessness and lack, appealing to me in my comfort, peace and sufficiency for some kind of grace. To him it must have seemed that I have given him some of my scraps and then blamed his shortcomings and misfortunes on his lack of faith. How shallow right?But God who is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart knew my inner cry for mercy for the meek man standing by my gate. I did not deserve anything more than he did ... and yet I have much more. In all sincerity I told him that even the most affluent people have needs, the rich and wealthy have struggles too, and battles to fight. In the end, whether an equipped lifeguard or non-swimmer, we are all ship-wrecked in a broken world amongst the waves of life, in need of a lifeboat. Neither have what it takes to reach dry land or solid rock. We are equally in need of a saviour.As a Christian you and I once was, much like a lifeguard, dependent on someone to train us how to swim and survive. Someone invested in training us and teaching us the truth. We can never blame the non-swimmer for a lack of faith to dive in if he has never been taught how to stay afloat. On that Wednesday I could have given this non-swimmer many material and tangible things \u2013 I could have handed him a life belt, yet I felt compelled to show him the lifeboat of prayer and to \u00a0introduce him to the Saviour who is our solid rock and the way to dry land.\u00a0My encounter with the needy nomad made me think twice about what I hand out.Let us not be caught racing our speedboats, throwing life belts at drowning brothers in deep waters, taking off to our beach villa and dare to think we have saved a life. They will surely perish. Hover a while, teach them how to swim in the truth, how to blow the whistle in faith and fire the rescue flare of prayer. And most importantly, make sure you tell them there is a Lifeboat waiting, willing to save. Yeshua the Messiah."

        "body": "We have reached our final destination! We have talked about the importance of prayer and how we can be loving and caring to other people. In this article, we will be summing up our preparation to share with the act of sharing itself.Before I begin, I just want to ask you_, do you remember a particular event in your life when you received some really good news?_\u2014you passed in all your exams, you got promoted to the job you always wanted, or you received a gift you\u2019ve been asking for. In my case, whenever I receive good news I tend to post about it online. I just can\u2019t contain the joy inside of me to the point that I keep on gushing about it over and over again. I know it sounds annoying but I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just happy of the good news I got.Now, do you remember the time when someone intentionally shared\u00a0_the_\u00a0good news to you? And by good news I mean\u00a0_the gospel_. How did you react?Remembering the days before someone shared the gospel to me, my life was a complete mess to the point I even considered ending my life. When I heard of the gospel, hope was the first word that came in to my mind and hope was the exact thing I was looking for then. After I heard of the gospel, I was extremely joyful that day. Honestly, when I got home that day I actually cried knowing what Jesus did for me.I\u2019ve been mentioning this passage since the start of this mini-series, and I\u2019m going to mention it one last time. It says in Matthew 28:19:\u00a0_\u201cGo therefore and\u00a0make disciples of\u00a0**all**\u00a0nations,\u00a0baptizing them\u00a0in\u00a0the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d_Jesus left us a commission to make disciples and\u00a0**for us to be able to make disciples, one should share the gospel.**At the very moment you accepted Christ as the Lord and Savior of your life, the Holy Spirit has dwelled upon you. The Holy Spirit is coequal with the Father and the son\u2014all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnipresent.I mentioned the Holy Spirit\u00a0**because it is important to be spirit-filled as we share the gospel.\u00a0**We are sharing the gospel not because you are obligated to do so, but you\u2019re sharing it out of the love you received and encountered from our Heavenly Father._Always check your heart._\u00a0Are you sharing because you were forced to do it? Are you sharing because of numbers? Are you sharing because you want to get others\u2019 approval? Or, are you sharing because you love the person and you want to introduce the gospel in his life; because you want the person to experience Jesus in his life?Being spirit-filled helps us have the right heart and right motives to share. It will reflect in the way you speak and act for you are under the influence of God himself. It also helps you share the gospel boldly because it\u2019s the Lord Himself that speaks through you. That\u2019s why if you truly understand what God has done for you and how He has been transforming you (from the inside out), you would know what you will be sharing to the people around you.Remember, regardless of what the person\u2019s response be to the gospel, we must leave it to the Lord.\u00a0_Our mission is to share and not force someone to believe and accept Jesus._\u00a0God will be the one who is going to change the person\u2019s heart towards the gospel and\u00a0**not**\u00a0us.We are His messengers and messengers only deliver the message.This reminds me of the passage from the book of Romans chapter 10:14-15:\u00a0_\u201cHow then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in Him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!\u201d_**Don\u2019t keep the gospel to yourself.**\u00a0If you truly love and care for someone, you will get out of your comfort zone and deliver to them the good news. You would want them aware of the greatest love they can ever receive and what life\u2019s most meaningful relationship is.Remember that you are not alone in this journey. You have the Holy Spirit to depend on. Before you share, ask the Holy Spirit, through prayer, to dwell in you and lead you. Ask Him to empower you and help you to obey and do God\u2019s command. Also, remind yourself that He is always in control.So have faith and go! Share!Written by [Carlos Panganiban](http://ph.yesheis.com/en/blog/author/carlos-panganiban)"

In just a few clicks we can share inspirational videos to all people who are on social media.__I do a lot of church ministry work, but I also currently work at a Software Development Company with the intention of sharing the Gospel. One of my goals is to encourage and to share Jesus to my CEO. I consider my workplace as a ministry also.__Personally, yesHEis helps me with my spiritual journey. There are times that I still remember my mum\u2019s passing due to cancer last year. It\u2019s really tough and heartbreaking, but the videos inspire me to continue my walk with God. The Lord has driven me to share more of my testimony with all who are hurting, and those who have lost their loved ones.\u201d__\u201cyesHEis boosts my confidence in God, that whatever season of life I\u2019m in right now, He will see me through.

That twinge whispers to us that if we don\u2019t share Jesus today, we\u2019re somehow not keeping up with God\u2019s expectation.God\u2019s grace in salvation is an immeasurable gift by which we are eternally indebted, however, what if God doesn\u2019t expect us to attempt to pay back the gift of Salvation? What if we actually can\u2019t receive the gift if we\u2019re also trying to pay it back?>_Salvation isn\u2019t an I.O.U. It\u2019s an adoption certificate into God\u2019s\u00a0family._Salvation is an initiation to spend the rest of our lives (and then eternity) with Jesus. There are no \u2018should\u2019s\u2019, just opportunities to share the joy you already have because of Jesus. Relationship with Jesus is the point. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s adventurous and delightful. That\u2019s what we\u2019re sharing.It\u2019s like being adopted by a multi-billionaire. God has the means to provide for all your needs, and your neighbour, and your work friends. There is always room for an extra person at God\u2019s table, and room to join the family.**We don\u2019t share because we must, we share Jesus because we want to. Jesus is the point of our life. Sharing Jesus is natural when our relationship with Him is a natural.**"

        "body": "I went home one night via Uber and a had good chat with the driver. He said the car is his daughter\u2019s. He\u2019s the one driving since he has nothing really to do. I saw a rosary by the rear-view mirror, started at it for a bit, and then just kept asking generic questions. When I got home, I told him to take care and thanked him for the ride and even gave him a high rating on the Uber app.\u00a0I found myself wondering why I stared at the rosary. Then it hit me, and it was obvious:\u00a0_Why didn\u2019t I go out of my way to share Jesus to the driver?_It was a lost opportunity. I felt disappointed with myself because I was praying for more opportunities to share my faith,\u00a0**God led me to an opportunity, and I didn\u2019t take it.**One of the challenges in the Christian culture I believe needs to be addressed is what I would call\u00a0_\u201ccomfortable Christianity\u201d._\u00a0I\u2019m one of those people who grew up satisfied with my own salvation but had no burden to really go out of my way to share the Gospel to my friends, relatives and even random people I meet along the way.\u00a0Jesus said this:\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u201d \u2013 John 13:34\u00a0Our salvation speaks about such love. That we are loved by a loving God who willingly forgives**. But a lot of Christians settle for just basking in that feeling of being loved and not do anything about it.**\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m saved, I\u2019m good.\u201d No urgency to share to others. No burden at all. And that is bad. That is really, really bad. We need to get out of such a rut. We need to be able to really make a difference and go the extra mile to tell people about Jesus.\u00a0Take Jama for example, who shared that growing up he felt unloved and worthless but God turned his life around and he experienced the love of Jesus and what He has done on the cross for his sins. When he truly understood, he became intentional with sharing the Gospel to people. I am a personal witness to how this brother in Christ really reaches out to people, so I can boldly say that not only does he feel loved, he knows his identity is found in Jesus who loves him infinitely.This identity in Christ should not keep us glued to our seats. It should make us move. It should give us a burden to reach out to the lost. It should give us a sense of urgency. If we truly love people, we will tell them the truth found in Jesus, and leave the results to God.Time is wasted on lost opportunities to share Jesus. Make the next one count."

        "body": "People\u2019s objections to faith are often because of bad experiences with religious people. They feel judged. Jesus said: \u201cDo not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\u201d _Mat 7:1\u20132_ Religious culture can be judgemental, and it isn\u2019t easy to just stop. It\u2019s because right and wrong is embedded in our thinking.Judah Smith, in his book, \u2018Jesus Is ...\u2019 writes about this thinking:> \u201cHere\u2019s how I assure myself I\u2019m doing good. I make up rules to fit my standard of living, the I judge you by them. If you follow my rules, you\u2019re a good person. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a bad person. If you have stricter rules than me, you\u2019re a prude who needs to lighten up.\u201dWe create our own delusion by creating our own rules to make ourselves feel better because we haven\u2019t been as bad as others. However, God tells us we have all have sinned; we have all fallen short of the mark. Judah admits that his way of thinking is wrong. Can we do the same?If we can, we realise there is no need to avoid sinners. In fact there is a need to go out of our way to engage with sinners. Everyone has sinned and needs Jesus grace, so we\u2019re all on the same level.> Part of honestly sharing our faith is acknowledging with others our own inadequacy without God, and the great news that Jesus wants to welcome us into the family\u00a0anyway.**If we must keep rules and judge others to feel good/worthy about ourselves, we\u2019re preaching the wrong Gospel.**"

        "body": "10-20 chats a day.Depression. Pornography. Broken marriages. Unfortunate breakups. Lost and no direction. These are just some of the usual conversations I get from the people I talk to daily.Part of my work in my church is being responsible in responding to online chats/messages we get daily (which includes engaging with our users in yesHEis). While some of them are just usual church inquiries, most of them really share their struggles very openly.One particular yesHEis user struck me the most. He messaged that he was a worship leader at his church, but is struggling with pornography. He came across my video testimony about my own struggle with pornography and got encouraged. He admitted that he was living a double life and didn\u2019t tell anyone in church about it, his Pastor and parents included. It gave me a good opportunity to spend a lot of time reaching out to him and sharing to him similar experiences that could help him overcome his struggle.A lot of people are hurting online. Today we live in a time when people are more expressive online because of the rise of social media and our tendency to adapt to an online community.I believe these are exciting times for the Gospel. It says in Matthew 24:14, \u201cand this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\u201d Today\u2019s technology makes this passage so real. It\u2019s easy to share Jesus with one click of a button.Let me end with two encouragements on how we behave on social media as Christians:1. **BE INTENTIONAL, PLANT SEEDS.** Don\u2019t waste your online presence. As a follower of Christ, always have the mindset to reach out either with a public post or a private conversation with someone. You\u2019ll never know how God can use you to plant seeds in these people\u2019s hearts. _Bless people online._ If they start engaging with you because of a post, you can privately share to them how God has been working in your life for example. A strategy like that is not threatening, because it is something that they cannot refute because it\u2019s your testimony. That\u2019s being intentional in planting seeds in their hearts.2. **BE MISSIONAL, ENGAGE WITH THE GOSPEL.** God creates opportunities through us so the Gospel can be preached. In being intentional, God can open the hearts of people to hear the Gospel. Once you sense that, take that step of faith and share the Gospel to people. For example, if they become curious and they say \u201cI wanna who Jesus really is\u201d or \u201cPlease tell me more,\u201d you should see that as an opportunity to share the Gospel. If you\u2019re not confident in sharing we can help you and you can check some of our practical tips in sharing the Gospel on our app.\u00a0Bottom line is this: The online space is a mission field. Find the urgency in your heart to tell people about Jesus.Written by: Jeff Lucas"

Here\u2019s the thing though\u2026 No one is \u2018good enough\u2019 for God. Luckily, our faith in God and His love for us isn\u2019t based on being good enough for Him.Whether we make one mistake in our life or many, we all fall short of God\u2019s standard. That is not something to get down about. The story of the Gospel and the power of grace blows that issue out of the water! (Thank God for Jesus and the Cross) Yet, so often people don\u2019t share their faith because they feel condemned that they don\u2019t measure up. They get stuck on themselves.> Be encouraged, it\u2019s not about you, It\u2019s about\u00a0Jesus!Jesus is the most revolutionary person to have ever lived! If you can know Him for who He truly is your life will be forever changed.Those who share their faith based on their own works don\u2019t truly know Jesus. Here\u2019s why \u2014 True faith isn\u2019t looking at what I did yesterday to determine if I am holy enough to share Jesus today. True faith is knowing that I\u2019m righteous because I\u2019m in a loving relationship with Jesus, not because I ticked all the boxes.**Sharing Jesus ought to be from an overflow of a thankful heart for what Jesus did, not from a place of guilt for what you haven\u2019t done.**If you\u2019re stuck on you, don\u2019t stay stuck."

        "body": "Being born and raised in a Christian family, I met Jesus as my Lord and Savior at a young age. I was the typical goody-two-shoes Christian girl actively serving in church. But, there came a point when I sought control over my life because I thought I knew what was best for me.During college, I dated a man; thinking that God was calling me to save him from the bondages of worldliness. It didn\u2019t take long before the relationship became unhealthy and displeasing to God. While enjoying worldly pleasures, I served in church and discipled other women. I lived a double life and the longer I stayed, the more I neglected Jesus. I did unimaginable things\u200a\u2014\u200athings I told myself I would never do.I was falling deep in sin, but the Holy Spirit constantly nudged me. Until one night, He put me on my knees and made me see how much I had changed\u200a\u2014\u200afor the worse. God made it clear that it wasn\u2019t my job to save him. God told me to end the relationship, and by His grace, I did.Breaking up with him didn\u2019t change the fact that I had already fallen. I fell in a deep pit of condemnation. All of the bad decisions I made, they haunted me every day. I hated myself. I felt like trash\u200a\u2014\u200adirty and unwanted. For two years, I believed that I was no longer worthy of love. After all of the terrible things that I\u2019ve done, I thought no decent man would ever accept me and love me. The trauma, guilt, and shame brought by my sins consumed my heart. The worst part was that I kept it all to myself.I hid all of the pain beneath my big smiles and loud laughs, but God saw me. He saw me in my rebellion. He saw me in my failures. He saw me in my brokenness. But even after He saw me, He loved me\u200a\u2014\u200ajust as He had always loved me. God\u2019s love healed my heart.This is why I write. I want the whole world to know of God\u2019s unconditional love. There is a love that keeps no record of wrongs. There is a love that heals every bit of pain. There is a love that gives hope, joy and peace. And this love comes only from God. The world deserves to know that there is a God who loves them more than they could ever imagine. I want them to experience the overwhelming saving grace that God\u2019s love gave me.2 Corinthians 5:14\u201315 says, \u201cFor Christ\u2019s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.\u201dJesus\u2019 death on the cross is the reason for the life I live today. I no longer live to pursue my own will and desires, but to pursue His will and desires for my life. It is His love that compels me to write.For more than a year now, I\u2019ve been writing about God\u2019s story in my life. I write about my successes and my mistakes along with the lessons that accompany them. I gladly share these to others in hopes that they would be inspired by God\u2019s faithfulness and learn from my mistakes as well.I\u2019ve published almost 20 blogs now, but one thing remains\u200a\u2014\u200awriting is not easy. The more I write, the more my mistakes, weaknesses and failures are revealed\u200a\u2014\u200aall the more I become vulnerable for the world to see. But all of this vulnerability becomes worth it whenever God uses me as a channel of blessing to others.Words cannot express how much joy I feel when I witness God use a simple story to change the heart of a person. People from different walks of life, with different struggles of their own, most of them are people I\u2019ve never met; they talk to me and tell me about how God spoke to them through my story. They speak about how they were blessed seeing Jesus\u2019 strength through my weaknesses. They tell me about how my story inspired them to truly love, trust and obey God more. It\u2019s truly amazing.God gave me a burden to boast of my weaknesses, my hardships, and my persecutions, for His glory. And it is a burden that I dearly cherish\u200a\u2014\u200aa burden that has now touched about 50,000 people around the world. And I know for sure that it is not my own doing, but His.Before I faithfully followed God, I had to fail miserably at first. But, the truth is, you don\u2019t need to fail before you follow."

And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\u201d_\u00a0Clearly, God is calling us to serve Him by\u00a0**sharing the gospel**\u00a0but we find ourselves stuck with the pre-command of\u00a0_go_. It\u2019s difficult for us to say yes to our Nineveh\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s, and so we can\u2019t even proceed with the real command of making disciples.But if we look closely into our hearts and assess the root cause of why we fail to say yes, it is because of disobedience. We, not only deny our duty to the Lord but also, show that we do not love Him completely. Jesus had asked his disciples, which applies in our moments of disobedience, **\u201cWhy do you call me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 and do not do what I say?\u201d** (Luke 6:46).\u00a0_Sharing the gospel is not an option that God gives us to so we can serve Him. It should be the goal of everything that we do._In one of our meetings for the upcoming B1G 13 Leadership Conference, a good friend of mine gave our opening devotional by talking about Moses and his stubbornness in Exodus 4. What struck me the most was when he said,\u00a0**\u201cGod will address all these concerns, you just have to say yes.\u201d**\u00a0There are many ways we can share the gospel, and I would like to encourage you to do so with every opportunity you get.## Say Yes to\u00a0PassionWe are all passionate about something: family, music, food, etc.; and we find ourselves chasing after every dream possible. These passions, these dreams, God uses them so we can minister and be part of God\u2019s work. He doesn\u2019t call everyone to go to another country and become a missionary. He has used bloggers, photographers, singers, dancers, and different kinds of passionate people to be a vessel of His love and grace to those who need it.Say yes to God by serving Him and bringing glory to Him. Share the gospel of Jesus by giving back with what He gave you.## Say Yes to\u00a0PeopleWe are beings created to have a relationship with Him, and to have relationships with the people around us. We are each other\u2019s\u2019 source of encouragement, hope, and love. There are days when others need us\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes as a confidant, a source of advice, or just someone to lean on to\u200a\u2014\u200aand we have the tendency to think of ourselves first.Say yes to God by demonstrating love to people He puts in your life. Share the gospel of Jesus by sharing His love through your actions.## Say Yes to\u00a0PurposeWe, at some point, are all visionary\u200a\u2014\u200athinking about our future and what lies ahead. We think about how we\u2019d want to be known or what would make us believe that we lived a fulfilled life. But at the end of the day, our mission should be geared towards the expansion of His kingdom. Whatever you\u2019re doing, wherever you\u2019re going, maximize the chances and share.**Say yes to God by fulfilling His purpose in your life wherever He takes you.

What am I supposed to learn from this?_It was extremely hard for me to process what my friend must have been feeling to do something so hurtful. The pain my friend was feeling not only hurt, it caused them to isolate themselves, too._Isn\u2019t there anything I could do?_ I wasn\u2019t in the position to really \u201cdo\u201d anything. I felt helpless and it made me question myself. I doubted whether I was good enough as a friend or if they even considered me a friend at all.As I waded in my uncertainty, I had to take action: _what do I do with these negative thoughts?_I thought back to when I was younger and kept prayer-journals.I used to keep a notebook of my prayers to God. The pages are filled with names of people I love and my specific plea to the Lord about them. I write out my concerns and faith-stretching situations. I also write down verses that helped me trust and have faith in God. It\u2019s a reminder that God hears and answers my prayers.When the answered prayer comes, I write the conclusion and date, then highlight it so that it stands out. Going back and rereading my history with God strengthens my confidence in Him. It also reminds me that I can keep going in faith.As David wrote in the Psalms: _\u201cHe will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber\u201d _(Psalm 121:3).As I reflected on God\u2019s past faithfulness, the fears in my heart began to silence. Slowly, my spirit recalled how God has been with me and my faith began to rise.God may not have solved all the problems yet but He gave me a renewed sense of hope that I could trust Him no matter what was going on.So the next time you\u2019re going through a challenge, grab a notebook, and do what I did to remember God\u2019s faithfulness:1. **Write it out. **Include the date and details. Be honest with God about how you feel. The Bible says, _\u201cCast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you\u201d _(1 Peter 5:7).\u00a02. **Look to the Word**. Allow the words of God Himself to counter your fears. We can trust that He will be faithful. Write the verse down.3. Leave space. (This is the hardest part!) Believe that God will answer your prayer -do it _by faith. _Remember, though, that it will happen according to His time. Don\u2019t just \u201ctrust the process\u201d, trust _His_ process!I have a very forgetful heart but when I remind myself of all the times God has proven that He cares for me, a boldness begins. I can then trust that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love Him. (Romans 8:28)Remind your heart: _What you\u2019re facing is a challenge. It isn\u2019t defeat, but challenges in life are an opportunity for God to show His faithfulness._I look forward to it. What about you?---Written by Ica Imanuele"

But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?

Only Jesus can change a life around and he experienced such grace and forgiveness.Jesus sanctifies us every day through the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives, but our sinful nature fights for power as well, leading to our flesh being the main antagonist we face until we are called into our eternal home in heaven. We can\u2019t relax in this life. We can\u2019t allow our flesh to win. This is not about perfection, but clamoring for sanctification.Jesus has already overcome the world. We need to believe in the victory we have in His Name moment by moment. And if we truly align with Him through His Word and total dependence on the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in our lives, we will finish well by His glorious grace alone."

        "body": "Meet Kamal, an awesome guy \ud83d\udc71\ud83c\udffb we met in Mumbai while shooting some testimonies. However, something about Kamal really stood out, he was relentless in his pursuit of Christ and made sure everyone knew that about him.\u00a0When we asked him about this desire of his he replied, \u201cI love using innovative ways to proclaim God\u2019s word and the name of Jesus.\u201d\u00a0He then showed us pictures of the various ways he\u2019s gone about proclaiming Jesus\u2019 name. Something that really stood out to us was the fact that he showed no signs of slowing down. He was constantly talking with us about new ideas he had, new tattoos he was thinking of getting, and new ways he could redesign his car so that he could be \u201clouder\u201d \ud83d\udcef in the ways he was proclaiming Jesus. Needless to say, we were inspired and encouraged by him and his enthusiasm to share the \u271d\ufe0f Gospel.> How does someone like Kamal become so passionate about Jesus? It all began when he got married to Muskan, who was a secret believer. Kamal didn\u2019t care for Christ too much, as far as his life was concerned, he didn\u2019t need Christ. That all changed when he met with a serious bike accident and nearly destroyed his knee. in fact, the damage done to his knee was so bad, that the doctors were recommending knee replacement surgery. In excruciating pain, he allowed for his wife and some members of the church she was attending to come and pray for him. He can only describe what happened after as \u201cmiraculous\u201d, because he experienced a complete healing in his knee. What he went through changed his life completely, and transformed him into the person he is\u00a0today.The Kamal we see today \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd is \u201call about\u201d sharing Jesus, and nothing seems to be stopping him. Popularly and affectionately known as the guy with the yesHEis tattoo, Kamal has gone to great heights to let people know that he is a follower of Jesus and is truly changing the way we think about sharing our faith.So.. What did I learn\u00a0> \ud83e\udd14\u00a0from Kamal? I learned that when I can be truly innovative, I can take the message of Christ where I\u2019ve never been able to take it before. Like Kamal, if we can all constantly strive to be more and more creative in the ways we proclaim Christ, we can truly make an impact \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u00a0on our culture.What have you learned from Kamal and his Story?"

        "body": "Sometimes when we share the gospel, we get so attached to our gospel tracts that they act as a crutch. Sometimes we even lose confidence when we don\u2019t have our materials on hand and we lose an opportunity to share the gospel.If you\u2019re not the best at memorizing verses, it\u2019s really useful to have these guides as we evangelize. However, as helpful as these tools are, Shallah shares a *_handy*\u00a0_way to remember the important points of the gospel using, well, your hand!##### 1. THUMBWe use the thumbs up sign to like or approve something good. The good news is:\u00a0**God LOVES you and has a wonderful plan for your life.**_\u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d\u00a0_(John 3:16)_\u201cThe thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\u201d_\u00a0(John 10:10)*Note: The thumbs up sign points up to Heaven, the thumbs down sign points down to Hell.##### 2. INDEX\u00a0FINGERWe shake this finger at someone when they did wrong. The thumb and the index finger have the widest gap between them.\u00a0_Notice, too, that the gap forms a gun that can kill\u200a\u2014\u200aFor the wages of sin is, bang! Death._\u00a0It reminds us that:\u00a0**Man is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God. Therefore, he cannot know and experience God\u2019s love and plan for his life.**_\u201cfor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\u201d\u00a0_(Romans 3:23)_\u201cFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in[a] Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d_\u00a0(Romans 6:23)##### 3. MIDDLE\u00a0FINGER\u00a0It stands the tallest among the rest of our fingers. The middle finger represents God\u2019s power and victory over sin through one Man.**JESUS CHRIST is God\u2019s only solution to man\u2019s sin. Through Him you can know and experience God\u2019s love and plan for your life.**_\u201cJesus answered, \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d_\u00a0(John 14:6)##### 4. RING\u00a0FINGER\u00a0We wear on this finger the symbol of our relationship and commitment with someone special. In the same way, God desires a relationship with us.**We must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord by faith. Only then can we know and experience God\u2019s love and plan for our lives.**_\u201cYet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c_\u00a0(John 1:12)_\u201cFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u200a\u2014\u200anot by works, so that no one can boast.\u201d_(Ephesians 2:8-9)_\u201cHere I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.\u201d_\u00a0(Revelation 3:20)##### Then, you may invite them to receive Christ by faith through prayer. Here is a suggested prayer:_\u201cLord Jesus, I want to know you personally. I\u2019m sorry for going my own way. Please forgive me for all my sin. Thank you for dying on the cross to pay for my sin. I agree to turn from my old ways and follow You as my Savior and Lord. Please come and take first place in my life.\u201d_*Note: Ask the person if this prayer expresses the desire of his/her heart. If it does, lead the person in prayer, phrase by phrase aloud.##### 5. PINKY\u00a0FINGER\u00a0As it is the shortest finger, it reminds us of the need to continually grow in our relationship with Christ. How do we\u00a0**GROW**?**G**et to know God by reading the Bible daily. (2 Tim. 3:14\u201317)**R**espond to God in prayer. (Phil. 4:6)**O**bey God moment by moment.

        "body": "> Jomar Valencia, 20 years old, grew up in a place where fighting, gambling, and addiction were the norm. Exposed to this kind of life at such a tender age, Jomar grew up without a dream and lived most of his teenage years drowning in alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, and women.> Best known for his \u201cbad boy\u201d image, Jomar dropped formal school at 2nd year high school. His daily life was engulfed in bullying others and causing a ruckus, which caused him to be summoned to the school\u2019s guidance office seven times in one year. Caught up in a whirlwind of self-destruction, Jomar made it his personal mission to destroy those around him as well.> Jomar became full of inner turmoil and eventually lost interest in life. His spite and anger was rooted from his desire to be genuinely loved by his family. With a gaping hole in his heart, Jomar succumbed to the idea that he lost his chance of having a good life. He thought to himself, \u201cthis is where I am now, so this is where I\u2019ll continue to give myself.\u201d**A God of second chances**> Little did Jomar know that God was actively working in his life. One day, Jomar found an UPLIFT Cares Back-To-School Program flyer posted in the health center near his house. He decided to give education another shot, so he enrolled himself in the program.> It wasn\u2019t an easy transition for Jomar. He still had the same stubborn heart inside and this gave a hard time not only for himself but for his Instructional Mentor and classmates as well. But the persistence and patience of his Instructional Mentor soon paved the way for a complete metanoia.> Upon the invitation of his Instructional Mentor, Jomar soon attended Elevate in CCF Cambridge. He initially went with the guise of finding girls. His heart was filled with doubt so he continued to ridicule those around him. He did not understand why people were praising God with their eyes closed and their hands held high. But soon enough, Jomar felt as if every topic was designed for him. He soon felt his heart changing and his desire for the Lord growing. He enjoyed not only his classes with UPLIFT Cares, but he anticipated going to Elevate as well. Jesus Christ was slowly materializing in his life as a catalyst of change.**God will use others to help you**> In January 2015, Jomar finally accepted Jesus Christ into his heart as his personal Lord and Savior. As he was surrounded by people who loved Christ, he soon developed an intense passion and desire to share Jesus to others. From a life strangled by vices, he now confidently holds a Bible in his hand and a changed heart inside of him. However, Jomar\u2019s environment did not change. He still came home to a place full of resentment and persecution.> The Lord had a wonderful plan for Jomar\u2019s life. Although he admits that his flesh still longs for the pleasure of a wayward life, he also proudly says that Jesus Christ keeps him incheck. At present, Jomar is a regular speaker and the dance ministry head in Elevate CCF Cambridge. With the help of UPLIFT Cares and Tany Foundation, Jomar is also in his second year of college in ICCT College.> Jomar is a perfect example of how God uses other people to help us change our lives. Now, he is capable of using his testimony to witness and inspire others. He has even brought his family to church and constantly engages them in Bible study. Jomar\u2019s life reminds each and every one of us that the Christian race is not about who finishes first, but rather, it is about helping others get to the finish line.Only God is capable of causing a complete 180-degree turnaround of us. And just like in Jomar\u2019s life, it\u2019s vital for us to persevere and invest in people. Sharing the gospel isn\u2019t the hardest part -its the continual investment we ought to make in the lives of people we witness to. But, just like in Jomar\u2019s story, witnessing a new life turning to Christ is always worth it."

This is where UPLIFT Cares takes the lead.**Who We Are**UPLIFT Cares Global Movement Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization and a recognized ministry under Christ\u2019s Commission Fellowship. We seek to serve and cater to the holistic growth of out-of-school youth and adults from all over the metro through DepEd\u2019s Alternative Learning System (ALS). In this pursuit, UPLIFT Cares upholds a four-fold program that serves Health, Education, Livelihood, and Personal Growth (HELP).With their HELP program, UPLIFT Cares engages in extensive community work in the areas of Pasig, Quezon City, Rizal, and Cavite.**Battlefield**It takes a brave soul to pursue the kind of work that UPLIFT Cares does. With only 35 people serving full-time, the ratio between staff and beneficiaries is rather disproportionate. Nevertheless, what fuels each and every person working behind the scene is the desire and the passion of serving God by ministering to the poor. Through His love, serving over 1,500 beneficiaries is not an impossible feat. And because of Him, we witness a unique joy in every transformed life.Working in and for the community is similar to the life of a soldier in the battlefield. As we face opposition and trials every single day, it can become physically bruising, emotionally exhausting, and spiritually draining. With the end-goal of saving souls, UPLIFT Cares aims to pursue discipleship in every project they implement. Serving defeated souls is exceptionally challenging but we fight to reignite the hope in their lives and lay down the foundations for their spiritual walk.In this battlefield, it is more than just the number we serve, but the number of souls we lead towards Jesus Christ. His sacrifice on the cross reminds us that no pain in this world cannot be overcome. His sacrifice prompts us of our responsibility not just to live well, but to bring others to the path of righteousness.**Uplifting lives through your help**Much like every other pursuit, the work of UPLIFT Cares will not be possible without the help and prayers of those around us. It is through our individual sponsors, ministry, and corporate partners that we are able to do God\u2019s work for our needy brothers and sisters. Helping others is not an easy task, nor is it a one-time commitment. As long as we are in this world, our duty as Christians is to cultivate His love and goodness in the lives of those around us.If you have the burden to help, you only have to look around. There is more than one way where you can use your time and talents to spread His hope and His promise of salvation. Encourage and challenge your brave soul to come out of its shell. There is so much you can do to truly UPLIFT the lives of those around you.Hebrews 6:10 says, \u201cGod is not unjust, He will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.\u201d Our prayer is that God\u2019s love and His promise in this verse compels you to respond to His call. There is much more we can do with every prayer and every willing hand. In this battlefield, we are united in Jesus Christ. In this battlefield, not a single soul is left behind.Oftentimes we don\u2019t know how privileged we are until we encounter those who have next to nothing.

I often see her on my daily commute, also making her way to and from work.She walks with a guide dog and, having talked to her on the odd occasion she needs to be pointed in the right direction, I know she is totally blind. One morning, I stopped for her to cross a zebra crossing. As she strode across the road, oblivious to my gaze, God spoke to me about her everyday bravery.Not that she was exercising a great deal of bravery in that moment. She waited for the prompt from her guide dog that it was safe to proceed. As I halted, the pair then crossed with absent-minded confidence. After all, this was a normal part of her day.> Watching her, I thought of how difficult that task would be for me. If I were to attempt crossing a street, blindfolded, with a guide dog to follow, I would be terrified.I would stumble and fall, scared to trust the dog, with no idea if any cars were coming. The surroundings would feel totally alien to me without sight.I realised that for this young lady, there was a first time to do this. At some stage, she received a new guide dog. She had lessons to learn how to walk with him, read his signals, and trust him. She would have practised with a trainer in a safe area and then eventually ventured onto real streets with a person alongside her for safety. Finally, the day came when it was time for her to go out with her guide dog. Just the two of them. Navigating streets with other pedestrians, children and bikes. Crossing busy roads and finding her own way.I suspect that first day, she needed to muster a great deal of bravery. She would be concentrating, alert, nervous. Just as any of us would be at the first attempt of something new. In fact, she probably felt this way for a while. Maybe there were times it didn\u2019t go smoothly. A beeping car, a sudden bike in her path, a wrong direction. But in pursuit of independence, she pressed on with determination. Until one day she didn\u2019t need all that bravery. One day it was routine. She was confident and relaxed and enjoyed the sun on her face as she walked.> Sometimes, we look at others bravely sharing their faith and we think, I would be terrible at that, I don\u2019t know how they do it with such confidence. I will never get\u00a0there.But just like the young lady, with practise and determination, we can learn. Maybe you get nervous or it has not gone smoothly at times. But with God\u2019s help, it will get easier. It may take a great deal of bravery at first but if you persist, one day you will find you can share with people with confidence, relaxed and enjoying the experience.Taking the first step is simply asking God to help you to be alert to opportunities and to have the right words. Whether it be friends, family or the person sitting next to you on the train.**We are all capable of everyday bravery.**"

It\u2019s almost too overwhelming to think that a God of indescribable beauty, would be willing and more than happy to listen to us. It\u2019s quite easy to fall into a pattern of self-absorption.

        "body": "I remember it clearly like it was yesterday. I was stuck at a busy intersection behind a woman in a red station wagon. My car air conditioning had recently stopped working and the sun bore down like a blanket of fire. My mind could not fathom the thought process of the person in the vehicle before me. 2 minutes of earnest waiting seemed like 2 weeks. It was the opportune moment, why she couldn\u2019t turn the corner, I still don\u2019t know. Every muscle in my body was tense. My fingers were sore from tapping, my upper lip cramped and my patience thinned. Every millimetre of my voice box ached from holding frustrated words within. There had been so many breaks in traffic, yet she wouldn\u2019t move.Have you ever wondered why we get frustrated sitting in traffic behind slow-minded drivers, or deep down build rage when we miss the green and hit red at the traffic light? Is it the diminishing time in our day? The old adage that time is money and money makes the world go round, so to lose that time means you lose the money and your miscalculation at the lights makes the world stop spinning? Is it that we have become such a need and want \u2018right now\u2019 society that if we have to wait, it is not worth it? Is it that we rule our own lives so well that we treat ourselves like royalty and expect the same treatment from others?> Your greatest ability is your availability.Often I don\u2019t think that is the case. I think we try and circumvent our frustration by blaming it on time or blaming it on need or ego. Think about this, if we were to remove time from the equation for a moment and destroy the inner wants of instant gratification, even take a step aside from what we need and look again at the busy intersection scenario. The only thing left standing is opportunity.As I sat behind the women at the intersection, all that sat before her and I was opportunity. Gap after gap in traffic went past but she refused to seize the moment. I was not upset because she was wasting my time. More so it was that deep down sense, that inner whirlwind that needed to see others successfully grasp their opportunities. It is built within us all. The need for more, the need to grow, change and advance in life. So to witness opportunity after opportunity fall breathlessly to the ground hurts even onlookers to a situation.> Humanity is built on individuals, individuals within communities, communities who work together for a common good. So to see another individual in absence of opportunity hurts the greater community.We as the Christians are working together not only for the common good but also for the eternal good and the eternal good requires us to live a counter cultural life.When a person we are connected to flourishes, we too flourish. When your church flourishes, the greater church flourishes. So when those before us miss their opportunities we miss ours. The truth of the situation was, that I could not receive my opportunity to turn the corner until she accepted her opportunity.That\u2019s not to say we cannot live our lives and accomplish great things until those before us do. More so,\u00a0**I believe the greatest things we accomplish with our lives are found when we help others take their opportunities.** Accomplishments shouldn\u2019t be about who we are or what have become, but rather what others become because of who we are.In the Bible Jesus had the audacity to add extra commandments to scripture. He took what humanity knew to date as their guidance to life, the 10 commandments and lifted the bar. He said in:[John 13:34](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3DJohn%252013%3A34-35)\u00a0\u2018_A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another_.\u2019 And then again in\u00a0[Mark 12:30](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3DMark%2B12%253A30%26version%3DMSG):\u00a0_\u2018__Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength. The second most important command is this: Love your neighbour the same as you love yourself. These two commands are the most important.\u2019_In a world that is so self-focused, it may seem counter cultural to prescribe a dose of \u2018loving others\u2019, but it\u2019s funny, when we snap out of our selfish mode to love others with the same grace and love that Christ has for us, suddenly the predicaments we find ourselves in often become opportunities.> Sometimes we must be counter cultural and do what we don\u2019t want to do to help other do what they were called to\u00a0do.What are the opportunities in others lives that we are ignoring in a pursuit of our own? Who could you help today? When we come with a heart to love and serve, it disarms and shocks people. Often our offers of service provide a platform for us to speak into people\u2019s lives.People spend their lives searching for identity and purpose, which they don\u2019t know are found in Christ. How great would it be to have a platform where people want to listen to what we say about Christ because they have first seen that we care.**Your greatest ability is your availability. Who are you making yourself available for today?**"

There is a link between personal devotion, character and living on mission. Those who live on mission can not do so well without first having a strong grounding in personal devotion.What do I mean by \u201cpersonal devotion\u201d? It\u2019s the basics that you often learn in a new Christian\u2019s course. It\u2019s the necessary things that feed our spirit and grow our own relationship with God.**Here are 4 basic habits to cultivate for a life on mission\u2026**- **Prayer\u200a\u2014\u200a**This is the most important. Prayer is talking with God. Prayer is asking and believing when things have yet to happen.- **Read the Bible\u200a**\u2014\u200aReading daily is a good idea. Really. Don\u2019t read until the end of the chapter, read until God speaks to you. That might happen two verses in or two pages in. When you read your Bible that way, you can not put it down and walk away unchanged in some way.- **Worship\u200a\u2014\u200a**This is looking at God with eyes and hearts wide open, so that we experience the God we love. It\u2019s breathtaking and mysterious.- **Fasting\u200a\u2014\u200a**Fasting food particular has this ability to tune your spirit and enhance the experience of the other three above. If your prayer\u2019s feel dry, your Bible boring and your worship dull and shallow\u200a\u2014\u200afast. I promise you that you won\u2019t be disappointed if you persist."

Then gradually your eyes grow adjusted to the darkness. And before you know it, you can see \u201cclearly\u201d. That\u2019s until you walk out into the light again, and the glare will make you want to run back to the darkness.We as Christians, are in the same position. It is a dark world we live in. Sin lurks around the corners, and as \u2018children of the light\u2019, we must strive to keep ourselves away from what this world calls \u201cNORMAL\u201d.**Their World**I know. It\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019re talking about a world that you and I are living in. But God has something to say about this._1 John 2:15\u201317_ says, \u201cDo not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world\u200a\u2014\u200athe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\u200a\u2014\u200ais not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.\u201dThese words of wisdom are pretty clear. In short, it means you have to separate yourself from how this world works. It definitely won\u2019t be easy, but with His help, you can overcome all of the temptations that this world offers.Be in this world,but not of it!**Your World**Be delightfully different for God. Think of how Jesus was when he walked the earth. Even with all the troubles that came towards him, he never stopped being kind and compassionate.Strive to be that EVERYDAY!At home, school, the streets, or at the shop. When you can make a difference, you will see God work His wonders into your life and the lives of others that you cross paths with.When worldliness and sin seep into your life, you can lose your place in God\u2019s kingdom. You are the light that has to shine for him. For the world to see who you are, you must not be a hidden light, but one that can be seen by everyone.>Matthew 5: 14\u201316 says, \u201cYou are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\u201dWherever you goWhatever you doLet your only joy should be that others can see Christ in you!"

While some parts of it were spent with family (which I truly valued a lot) other parts were simply about welcoming the \u201cbum life\u201d all over again. I didn\u2019t want to do anything at all. I just wanted to be in my own little cocoon and enjoy being a bum even if it was just temporary. I figured I deserved it because a big part of my day is consumed with long hours on the road and long hours in the office. Rest becomes so valuable so I enjoy vacations.But it made me wonder if as a Christian; am I living my life with a sense of urgency? Is too much rest becoming a hindrance from what I can do more for the kingdom of God?Now don\u2019t get me wrong. There is nothing with rest. In fact, God Himself rested on the seventh day after creating the world in 6 days. Jesus said \u201cCome to me those who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Jesus even slept and rested even during the storm, so rest in itself isn\u2019t wrong. But it should not be an excuse to come into a point of complacency and just chill, relax, and unwind, forgetting what it means to be a Christian for the time being.We all have a limited time on earth. Some live on average of 60\u201370 years, while some die younger. Way younger. And you begin to wonder that life is short.If life is indeed short, what are going to do about it as Christians? What are going to do as carriers of the Gospel that has breathed life into us?Do we share the Gospel to at least one person a day? I\u2019m not saying that it should be a requirement, but I am challenging how we make use of our time. If other people can live intentional lives in sharing the Gospel to others and making a big impact in the kingdom of God, why can\u2019t it be the same for you and me?I believe God always gives us opportunities to share the Gospel to people. Sadly, we do not grab those opportunities most of the time.I do not want Jesus to tell me one day when I meet Him face to face that I didn\u2019t use my time on earth wisely to share the Gospel. If we truly love Jesus and what the Gospel can do to a life of person, we should be passionate in being intentional in exercising our faith every single day of our lives.I have so much to learn, and instead of \u201cEAT. SLEEP. REPEAT.\u201d, I hope my life would become a daily dose of \u201cPRAY. CARE. SHARE.\u201d"

        "body": "Do you like waiting?For something you downloaded? For a friend you\u2019ll be meeting up with? For a package to be delivered? For a callback in a part of a play? For a job interview?As humans, it\u2019s natural for us to want convenience, for things to be done fast-paced and easily. We tend to be impatient with the little things: for a site to load, for food to be served, for calm in the middle of traffic, and a lot more. We want to be in control of everything. We want things to go as we want them to and to get things done as we planned. But sometimes, the total opposite of what we have in mind happens and it\u2019s frustrating; discouraging, even. What do you do then?When God made me wait for almost half a year to find a new job. It was not at all an easy and smooth journey. A lot has happened in those months, good and bad. I was able to focus on a channel I started; catch up, reconnect, and meet new people; go back to writing; and, learn new things about life and myself. On the other hand, I was also physically, emotionally, spiritually, and financially challenged. I found myself going to a handful of interviews back and forth but not being able to get into one of them which was very tiring and discouraging.But the Lord used a lot of things and people to remind me that His ways and plans are indeed higher and better than mine and that He has been preparing me for something better- that His timing is far more perfect than mine will ever be. Rather than dwelling on discouragement and pitying myself, I adjusted my perspective. I started to look at every rejection as a lesson to be stronger, wiser, and have more confidence. I chose to entrust everything I have and everything that I am to my Provider, my Healer, my Comforter, and to the One Who holds my future.Surely enough, when you wait on the Lord, everything is and will be worth it. As the year of 2018 started, a lot of opportunities came in and after a few days, finally, I was able to land a job- the one I know that God has been training me for.This experience reminded that just like in sharing the Good News- to family, friends, strangers, it\u2019s not always easy and most of the time, we experience rejection, we feel discouraged to the point that we just want to give up. But you have to keep on reminding yourself, especially in times like so: that Jesus didn\u2019t give up on us. He sacrificed a lot and was even persecuted just so could have an abundant life in Him.\u201c\u2026Let us run the race with endurance the race God has set before us.\u201d Hebrews 12:1, NLTWhen you feel like you\u2019re getting weak and tired, recharge and ask strength from Him, re-adjust your perspective and look for a new angle. FOCUS ON YOUR GOAL. Because at the end of the day, being able to put a smile on Jesus\u2019 face is always worth the wait."

Do that.\u201d_People love\u00a0_selfishly_. They only care about what they can get from such love, not thinking about the other person\u2019s welfare.Society has downgraded love into one-night stands and relationships with expiration dates; just toss people out if you\u2019re not happy anymore. Hollywood has given us a false idea of what love is, and the general public has accepted it. This has influenced relationships in a negative way.Why has the world come to this? Why have we seen so many relationships broken, families torn apart, immorality being rampant at a very young age?One simple answer: this world has been walking further and further away from the truths of God.The world has been pushing God\u2019s principles away and allowing humanity to redefine what love is. And because everyone is doing it, it\u2019s okay.We see churches around the world slowly compromising the foundations of their beliefs so that they won\u2019t be seen as enemies of the people. Truly, the Gospel has been affected, watered down and even redefined to be socially acceptable. There is a different Jesus floating out there,\u00a0one that is LOVE without repentance, sin, wrath and justice. Just LOVE. And as they say, \u201clove is all we need.\u201dScripture is so clear of how love should be defined:_\u201cLove is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;\u00a0__it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth__. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things\u201d_\u00a0(I Corinthians 13:4\u20137 ESV)Jesus Himself showed what true love is.\u00a0Agape. Self-sacrificial and unconditional. Just look at how He lived His life in the Gospels. He knows how to show love in the most selfless way \u2014 _by telling you the truth_. That you need forgiveness. That you need to turn away from your sin and follow Him. That you need to hear the hard truth like what He shared at the Sermon on the Mount which led to half of the people walking away from Him. That truth was that He died on the Cross as the ultimate act of love to His Father\u2019s will so that you and I can be redeemed.If you were a doctor and you find out your patient has 3 months to live, you wouldn\u2019t tell that patient \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You just need to take some medication and you\u2019ll be back to normal in no time.\u201d If you truly love a person, you will tell them the truth._The Gospel represents the ultimate truth_ \u2014 that God, because of His love for the world, sent His son Jesus Christ to die for our sins, so that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.That is selfless love. That is love that we shouldn\u2019t even deserve because we have sinned against Him, yet He has given us the only solution possible to be reconciled with Him.God\u2019s love emphasizes His hatred for sin.\u00a0The challenge we have now is the world allowing sin to become a norm that it becomes culturally acceptable. The responsibility as I see it, falls on the hands of the Church. The Body of Christ.If we allow God\u2019s standard of love to be saturated by the world\u2019s standard, we are failing our Savior. We are neglecting our duty to carry out the Gospel faithfully.God\u2019s love reminds us to be vigilant.\u00a0We should get out of our sense of comfort and be worried. We actually need to have a sense of urgency. The world is not getting better and better. Let\u2019s expect it to become worse and worse as Scripture has stated in what will happen in the last days. But that is no excuse for us to vigilant in our pursuit for people to hear the true Gospel, the true message of love and how it can make a difference in a person\u2019s life.As followers of Jesus, we are called to live life on mission. If we don\u2019t obey this call, then we need to question ourselves:\u00a0_Are we truly living our lives for Jesus?_"

One day I witnessed her get verbally attacked by someone else, and she crumbled. She was muddled and vulnerable and I immediately felt guilty for any time I had thought unfavourably of her.This is so often the case with people who seem to be in control and have it altogether.

There is something very inviting about a kind word softly spoken.Besides, kind words can be scarce on social media since the sense of anonymity often brings out people\u2019s darker side.

        "body": "When we look at the world today or we ask anyone what their concept of a family is, what do you think that is? On a literal perspective alone, there are already different kinds \u2014 different combinations of parents and kids, no kids, no fathers, no mothers, and so on. On a deep and meaningful experience, people would come up with words such as _home_, _comfort_, _love_, and the like to describe their families. But for the most part, even if love is evident in most families, we still experience complications: broken marriages, a parent having more than one family, siblings that don\u2019t get along, parents and children that don\u2019t see eye-to-eye, and so many more.John Piper wrote, \u201c_Family harmony is a good desire and something to work toward. But in God\u2019s plan, it may not be what is most needed. What may be most needed is for our family to be a crucible of grace, a place where the heat of pressure forces sin to surface providing opportunities for the gospel to be understood and applied. And when this happens the messes become mercies._When we go through the Bible, we realize that there are so many examples of families that experience various complications, various _crucibles of grace_.\u00a0In Genesis, an older brother kills his younger brother out of jealousy. In the same book, we see parents who played favoritism and competition with betrayal for a birthright. But if there\u2019s one Bible story that really showed a complicated family, it was Joseph\u2019s. With his ultimate highs and lows, he experienced so much love from his father that led to hatred from his brothers; got sold as a slave, became a high-ranking official, then a prisoner, and eventually Pharaoh\u2019s second-in-command. Joseph\u2019s brothers\u2019 hatred for him was his crucible of grace. God meant it \u2014 what was supposedly evil \u2014 for good. Genesis 50:20 says, _\u201cAs for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good\u2026\u201d _In all family Bible stories, most especially Joseph\u2019s, it\u2019s the message of **God\u2019s love and redemption **that speaks the loudest. But it\u2019s not just in the stories from the Bible, it\u2019s evident in the different families of today.It\u2019s so interesting to see that we all try to love each other within the family, but harmony isn\u2019t just always there. And there\u2019s nothing else to point at but our humanity and our sinful nature. You put two or more people in one household \u2014 where they have different personalities, desires, abilities, etc. \u2014 you can only expect such a mess. But just as God redeemed His people in the Bible, He is at work in the messes of our families. (Whatever aspect of our life) Even in our family situations, the gospel is so real and that us, as sinners, need God\u2019s grace daily.\u00a0The gospel teaches us that:1. we need to be aware that we are sinners2. we cannot save ourselves from the penalty of being a sinner,\u00a03. we need to believe and accept that Jesus is our Lord and Savior, and love Him,\u00a04. to love our fellow sinners. Where better to see all of these than in the family setting?And what better way to show love to your family by forgiving them \u2014 the same way God forgave us? Colossians 3:13 says, _\u201cbearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you must also forgive.\u201d_ In living with fellow sinners, we live with knowing that God loves and has forgiven them the same way He does with us. God\u2019s love and redemption for us was not meant to be kept for ourselves. It was meant to be extended to the people around us.Has anyone in your family hurt you recently? How do you normally resolve issues within the family? I encourage you to always begin with forgiving them right away, even if you haven\u2019t resolved it yet; the same way He has already forgiven you even before you confess to Him.Written by Deb Zara"

        "body": "Love is a word with multifaceted meanings, it always has been. There is a particular love we have for our family, a love we have for friends, a love we have for virtues, and a love we have for romantic partners. This last love mentioned is arguably the kind of love most people today appear to be fascinated by. There is a certain allure to _romantic love _that we seem to be hopelessly enamored by, and with every generation, this interest is expressed in various ways. The word that the Greeks used to describe this kind of love was \u201c**_Eros_**\u201d which expressed romantic, often sexual, love.Today, in the wake of the sexual revolution along with the advances in technology,** we\u2019ve fashioned a culture that views sex and romance as non-committal acts to be had at our whim with the swipe of a finger. **It\u2019s no longer considered unusual to have multiple sexual partners or be intimate with someone you barely even know. Anyone opposed to this view of sex is labeled a prude, closed-minded, or old-fashioned. The result is this: promiscuity being the new norm, being unable to find a sexual partner makes you a social outcast, and the idea of saving yourself for marriage appears nonsensical at best.> Ultimately, this insatiable desire for physical intimacy is rooted in a truly ancient and profound longing for something more than what the world can offer us.There is, in every person\u2019s soul, a God-shaped void that all people hopelessly try to fill. **It is the longing for God that fuels their heart's desires to the point of excess. **The Bible tells us in Jeremiah 2:13 \u201cfor my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.\u201dGod laments over fallen man\u2019s decision to find satisfaction in things that are destined to leave us wanting. He is the source of the love that we crave, and any attempt to find our heart\u2019s desire in anything else is doomed to failure. Now, you might be thinking, \u201cSure, considering salvation, God is the answer to our problem. But what does that have to do with my want to experience romantic love?\u201d After all, romantic love is not a bad thing.Surprisingly, **God does love us in a romantic way**. Not in a raw, sexual, and immoral kind of love, but **romance in its most ideal sense.**_God pursues us, appeals to us, cares deeply for us._ This is clear in the book the Songs of Solomon where it depicts the courtship, romance, and consummation of love between a husband and wife.\u00a0**God had designed marriage as a way for us to understand the intimacy He longs to have with us, the relationship of husband and wife mirroring the relationship between God and His people.** In Ezekiel 16, perhaps one of the most heartbreaking chapters of the Bible, God compares fallen mankind to an adulterous wife. But amidst the great pain and scandal expressed in this chapter is also a clear declaration of God\u2019s faithful love to us. He says in verse 8, \u201cThen I passed by you and saw you, and you were indeed at the age for love. So, I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. I pledged Myself to you, entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine.\u201d This is the declaration of the Lord God.\u201dDespite the demand for romance that has been felt across all past generations, and the sexual deviations to meet those demands in the present, the Christian has this romance that the soul longs for in Christ. And His love is enough to satisfy for all eternity. Those who put their faith in Jesus have a love and affection from a Perfect and Faithful Lover, God Himself. This love is not to remain an abstract idea, but a love that will be consummated in the second coming of Jesus, when the Groom comes for His bride, the church. With that, even when those who follow Jesus experience a lack of romantic partners here on earth, they still have a love that is promised in which they can be completely satisfied.In light of these profound truths, how can we answer the call to be salt and light to those who live in the darkness of this present age? How can we make much of Christ and share the satisfaction we have in Jesus to those who still look to promiscuity and meaningless sex as the solution to their loneliness? Only by remaining pure and conforming our lives to the Word of God can our testimony be seen and be made credible to those who are in desperate need of it. _So, let us not only proclaim the gospel and speak of its ability to save, but also live the gospel and enjoy the salvation we receive from it, daily choosing intimacy with God over the sin that only wearies the soul._> \u201cthe Lord appeared to him from far away.  > I have loved you with an everlasting love;  >\u00a0therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.\u201d> **Jeremiah 31:3**---Written by Jama Javier"

You were probably a twaddle-speaking toddler when someone said the \u2018love\u2019 word to you.But what is love? Is it heart-shaped gift boxes or a bunch of red flowers? Is it a fairy-tale Disney movie? Is it when someone says, \u201cI love you.\u201d? There are so many varied interpretations of this word, that it\u2019s almost impossible to find the right answer.> But as children of God, we do indeed have a place to seek the ingredients for this recipe of\u00a0love!As you know, there are many books in the Bible, but if there was a singular string running through them, it is love.\u00a0_Not only does God have love, but he is love._> ** 1 John 4:8 says,**> \u201cHe who does not love does not know God, for God is love.\u201d> Love is the reason Christ died for us.> Loving God and one another is a commandment.**And according to Isaiah 46:15, His love is stronger and greater than even the devotion of a nursing\u00a0mother!**Wow. That\u2019s some unfathomable love right there. So how can we love like this in our lives?1. ForgivenessForgiveness is not an emotion, it is a conscious decision. One of the hardest things for us to do is forgive. Not only others but sometimes even ourselves.When we do something wrong, and we can\u2019t explain why we did it, we beat ourselves down.But God has already forgiven us. All we must do is ask.> Ephesians 4:32 says,> And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.How can God forgive us if we aren\u2019t capable of forgiving others?2. SacrificePhew. We don\u2019t want to do that, do we? But we must.\u00a0_Putting our wants, needs, and desires aside to help somebody else is one of the key ingredients to love._> Romans 12:1 says,> \u201cI beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t have to be some extraordinary sacrifice. It can be something as simple as giving your seat up on the bus for a stranger or choosing not to argue with your annoying classmate over a varied viewpoint._Sacrifice needs a faithful heart with a joyful attitude!_3. Spreading the Good NewsAre we the secret \u2018Christian\u2019 club? I think not. When it comes to telling the world about Jesus, we must shout to the north, south, east and don\u2019t forget the west.> Mark 16:15 says,> \u201cAnd He said to them, \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201dWe won\u2019t frequently find the perfect time or place to speak about God. It may be not always be accepted well. You may be uncomfortable.> All of the above doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about sharing His\u00a0recipe and sacrifice of true and pure love with everyone!"

        "title": "Phileo\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Phileo-sophy of Love",
        "body": "I was one of those people who probably got excited knowing that F.R.I.E.N.D.S. arrived in Netflix. I grew up watching that sitcom and I\u2019ve always admired how deep their friendships were with each other.I grew up having a barkada in church and I can truly say that brotherhood has lasted this long because of the deep relationships we have built with each other. They knew all about my heartaches growing up and vice versa, so even if we do not get to meet for a long period of time it\u2019s still as if nothing has changed when we do, because the bond has already gone beyond the need of meeting regularly.That kind of friendship is what we call PHILEO\u200a\u2014\u200aa companionable and relational kind of love, mostly referred to as brotherly, deep and intimate.We see this kind of love expressed by Jesus in John 21:15\u201317. In that passage, Jesus asked Peter three times if he loves Him. If you study the original text, the first two times Jesus asked Peter, He used \u2018Agape\u2019 love\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is a kind of love that is not based on merit but an unconditional kind of love that is Christ-like no matter who it is, friend or enemy. \u2018Agape\u2019 love continues to be selfless even if the other person doesn\u2019t respond or rejects. Still, it chooses to be compassionate.Jesus, however, changed it up when He asked for the third time, using \u2018Phileo\u2019 love when He asked Peter if he loved Him. Knowing Jesus, who desires to have an intimate relationship with us, His intent was to make Peter think and process if he has really built a deep, intimate relationship with Him, a friendship that sticks closer like a brother. Yes, Jesus is God, but Jesus walked with Peter for three years and they have built memories together as seen in the Gospels. He wanted to know if Peter also loved Him not because He\u2019s God but because He is also a brother and a friend.When it comes to our Christian life, \u2018Agape\u2019 is the highest calling of love but \u2018Phileo\u2019 is valuable in our building relationships with the Body of Christ. \u2018Phileo\u2019 is tied up to our call for discipleship, because as we grow deeper in discipleship, we form bonds. We invest in each other\u2019s lives. As we learn about the other person, we form a bond that really connects us as brothers and sisters in Christ. The Christian life was not meant to be lived alone. The command to make disciples should be part of our spiritual journey.Not only that, I believe \u2018Phileo\u2019 love is needed as we deepen our own relationship with Jesus. He desires to have an intimate relationship with us, yet we find ourselves not giving the kind of love He wants from us. So what do we need to do to really practice \u2018Phileo\u2019 love when it comes to building our relationship with Jesus and others?_SPEND TIME READING HIS WORD.\u00a0_This should be something every believer should be doing on a daily basis. It\u2019s not really right to say we are followers of Jesus but we don\u2019t read the Bible. A lot of our users in the app ask how they can build on their faith, and I always say that reading the Bible is foundational and should be the first thing they should do to get to know more about who Jesus is so they know how to share about Him to others._CREATE A LIFESTYLE OF PRAYER._\u00a0A lot of people associate prayer as saying grace before meals or before sleeping. That is not all that is to prayer. It should be a lifestyle. The moment you wake up, as you go to school or work, when you\u2019re struggling, even in random moments\u200a\u2014\u200amake it a point to actively pray. Have short and long prayers and treat it as if you\u2019re talking to Jesus like a friend. No, I\u2019m not asking you to downgrade His holiness, but I want you to build a deep and intimate relationship with Him like He\u2019s also your friend. Also praying for people can really start the atmosphere of discipleship. You can think of the people in your proximity already whom you can reach out to and intentionally build relationships with them through prayer.At the end of the day, building a solid relationship with Jesus can really affect the relationships He has placed around you. Jesus will always pursue you. The question is, are you pursuing Him back the same way?By Jeff Lucas"

(Dead men don\u2019t get offended)  **Follow Him\u200a\u2014****\u200a**Allow Him to take control and leadA prominent television personality speaks of a \u201csuper human strength for us to meet in the middle\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aour super human strength comes from Jesus, in surrendering our lives to Him, we live and we are given the same power that raised Christ from the dead.As Christians, rather than adopting a natural posture of offence, supremacy or hate, let\u2019s continue to adopt the supernatural posture of forgiveness. Because we have freely received forgiveness, we can freely forgive.You will be surprised how many opportunities to speak the Gospel will open up when you adopt the posture of forgiveness."

        "title": "I Found My Purpose; Now\u00a0What?",
        "body": "_What is your purpose?_This has to be one of the most difficult questions I ever stumbled upon. It is actually so hard that I once found myself lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling, wondering what it could be. I\u2019ve been hearing this question often at church. And often times I\u2019d just ignore it until the question was personally asked to me.I didn\u2019t know how to respond.What about you? Have you ever thought of this question? Have you ever stopped and asked yourself what your purpose is? Why you exist? What YOUR life is all about?We all grew up chasing dreams, aiming to be successful in what we do, striving to excel in where we at. We always thought life is all about achieving. And most of us thought that our identity and our purpose is reflected on what we have achieved or what we have become.But what if we finally reach the point where we have allthe things we\u2019ve been dreaming and aspiring for, **what comes after?**_You see, we will always go back to the big question of \u201cWHAT IS MY PURPOSE?\u201d_In John 10:10, Jesus said> \u201c\u2026I came that they may have life and have it abundantly\u201dJesus came here to give us an abundant life\u200a\u2014\u200aa life with meaning, purpose, and joy. But most of us never experience this because we live our lives our own way. We never find that meaning and purpose because we want _our own_ versions of meaning and purpose to happen in our lives.\u00a0**We can only experience life with meaning, purpose, and joy if we choose to have a relationship with the Lord. **The Lord sacrificed His Son not only to demonstrate His love for us and to free us from the penalty of our sins, but also for us to experience the fullness of life with Him.Life is much more than just achieving the things we aspire for. It is not all about just working hard and doing our best to be successful in the field we\u2019re at. Our purpose in life is more than just being and becoming the best in what we do. Our purpose is to have a relationship with the Lord and to glorify Him in everything that we do (Colossians 3:23).Ephesians 2:10 says,\u00a0> \u201cFor we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\u201dPaul said that we are created in His own image and we are called to do good works. And good works don\u2019t just necessarily mean serving in the ministry or giving tithes. But it means **we are all called to keep His commandments and live with it. **You don\u2019t need a career-change and be a pastor or a full-time volunteer on your local church. You can work and do good works by being a salt and light to the people you\u2019re surrounded with. **No matter what you are, you\u2019re purpose is to give honor and glory to the Lord through the things that you do.**Wherever the Lord places us, inside or outside the church, our main purpose is to maximize the resources and time we have by obeying and glorifying God. If you believe that where you at right now is where the Lord has called you to be, then make use of your time by representing Jesus through obeying His commands and reaching out to your work mates, sharing them how the Lord demonstrated His love for us.As we live and follow His purpose for us, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to understand the meaning of life that will eventually bring true and lasting joy. This can all be possible if we choose to be in a relationship with the Lord by accepting His Son, Jesus, as our personal Lord and Savior.Remember,** we can only find the meaning of life and our purpose in Him**. Your purpose can never be found in what you have achieved or until where you have reached. They may seem to define who you are now but it will eventually make you grew tired and confused and later, lost due to our broken fellowship with Him.Written by Carlos Panganiban."

There are also times we don\u2019t understand why people do us wrong when we\u2019ve given them our best.We may forget some things, and sometimes we forgive. But we also have times where we cannot choose forgiveness. We\u2019ve seen in either our families or other people who have held a grudge against someone for years.They avoid the area the person lives in, the church the person goes to, and even the slightest thought of a person makes them cringe within._We may not have someone who we have not forgiven for years and years, but we must forgive even if it is something small that we\u2019ve held within ourselves secretly, even if it has been for a short while.__Although forgiving, as a human, may seem impossible and the world may say it\u2019s ok to not forgive, or many times remind us what wrong they did to us,__\u00a0__**the Bible teaches us that living with unforgiveness is not the right way of living.**__This is made clear in the Lord\u2019s Prayer_> \u201cAnd forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors\u201d Matthew 6:12Debtors here does not mean in the literal accounting terms, it refers to all aspects. It is made obvious that we cannot be righteous in God\u2019s eye if we cannot forgive others.> Remember, the reason we have the freedom to sit at His feet is that He forgave us, and as Christians, we ought to forgive and share what we have received.It may seem difficult. Yes of course, it is difficult. And we cannot, just CANNOT do it on our own.\u00a0But when we ask God for help, and as we strive to be more like Him, He gives us the grace and makes it easy to forgive and make peace with people.\u00a0This restores relationships, brings peace of mind and a guilt-free heart that can worship God.Forgiveness becomes easy when we understand His ways of loving people. When we are filled with God\u2019s love, it becomes easier to not have unforgiveness, hate or other sins that keep us away from God.> When Peter asked Jesus, how many times he should forgive his brother, Jesus answered seventy times seven.Let\u2019s not pull out the calculator app and set the countdown on our smartphones. Instead, let\u2019s strive to be like Him and be ever forgiving with His help and love, strengthening our relationship with God and people around us.**May our lives be a living testimony and display of God\u2019s\u00a0heart.**"

I wanted to be a Gasoline boy.I wanted to be that guy in the gas station pumping up gas in your tank, giving you a smile and chatting with you about promos and stuff. I\u2019d be overjoyed to be the one cleaning your windshield, because I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching that happen every time we stopped for gas. That was my dream. Nothing fancy. But that was my dream.I was never the kind of guy who really understood what kind of job I wanted to have someday, that\u2019s why in college I took a course that I can best describe as a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d type of course. I never really had a clear direction and it was a bit frustrating. But God was gracious to me.\u00a0_(Thank You Lord for being gracious.)_I had the privilege to be in Israel back in 2011 and I look at that experience as a defining moment in my life. God made it clear I was going to go full-time ministry through my personal devotions and prayer time while enjoying the fact that I was in Jerusalem. Didn\u2019t know when it would happen, but I just knew. I came back to the Philippines anticipating how my life would change, but the opportunity to go full-time in the church arrived three years later._And I\u2019ve been here since 2014._I\u2019ve been working in the church for 4 years now, enjoying it to the fullest, but I have realized so many things. As Christians, we have coined so many concepts that limit our understanding of how God can truly use us. Even I have been so guilty of this. Let me break down for you two misconceptions:_1._\u00a0Full-time ministry is limited to workers in the church, Pastors and missionaries._\u00a0_Let\u2019s break this notion once and for all. I had that understanding before that if I were to go full-time, I would either work in the church, train to be a Pastor or be a missionary. Even in church, the way we recruit people to work with us, we say \u201cPray about going full-time_.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t ministry be related to whatever work we\u2019re in, or where God has placed us to do His work?_\u00a0If you are a follower of Jesus who is a business, your company is your full-time ministry. You can still disciple._\u00a0_You can still conduct bible studies. You can still be intentional in bringing the Gospel to your workers. You are in full-time ministry wherever God has placed you._2._\u00a0Full-time ministry means you\u2019ll have to live a close-to-perfect life._\u00a0_A lot of people get so burned out because of the pressure they feel of working in the church. The term \u201cbeing above approach\u201d is mentioned in the Bible when it comes to qualifications of leaders but it is loosely used sometimes that it can really hurt a lot of people. Being above reproach means to be \u201cblameless\u201d or \u201cperfect\u201d so while working in the church, the pressure is so high to be perfect that you don\u2019t get to truly experience the freedom found in Christ. Newsflash\u200a\u2014\u200awe\u2019re still sinners while we are still living on this earth, so reality is you will stumble along the way.\u00a0_You will have struggles, but to be above reproach is to be consistently accountable_\u00a0through discipleship, to show integrity and confess when you have sinned, and to consistently pursue Christlikeness and to make sure you\u2019re passionately pursuing a life that is anchored in Jesus. Be real, be honest, get help when you need it, do not cover up sin in your life.Full-time ministry is basically your whole life.\u00a0God has uniquely created us to be different, and He has created us with various gifts for the kingdom. Whether you\u2019re an artist, a businessman, a corporate worker or a church worker, God\u2019s path for you is your full-time ministry. There should be no distinction because if you are truly a follower of Jesus, you are called to make disciples.1 Corinthians 10:31 says this,> \u201c> 31\u00a0> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\u201dIt is my prayer that you use your sphere of influence to really advance the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Let\u2019s stop making excuses and rationalizations.Remember, there is no such thing as a part-time ministry.

Sometimes the best approach to this is to use your \u2018judgment\u2019 and point out their mistake in a loving and respectful way._Matthew 18:15\u201317 says,__\u201cMoreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.

        "title": "A Lent-le and Quiet\u00a0Spirit",
        "body": "Despite being raised in a traditional and religious family, the meaning of Lent always somewhat escaped me. Lent seemed to be nothing more than an ambiguous season of fasting meat on Fridays and attending multiple church services. It was a time-honored tradition at best, and an inconvenience from everyday living at worst. But when I began to understand the essence of Lent and the opportunity it provided for myself as a believer in Jesus, I saw its purpose in shaping my life into the image of Christ.Lent spans 40 days, and within those 40 days believers are called to fast from some of their favorite things. The fasting is not done for abstinence sake, but so that _when we long for what we are fasting we would be prompted to pray and remember the suffering that Jesus endured as payment for our sins. _Although for most Christians this may be the only time they are exposed to fasting, it\u2019s actually a biblical spiritual discipline. Jesus expects His followers to fast for godly purposes. When Jesus teaches his disciples about fasting in Matthew 6:16\u201318, He begins by saying \u201cAnd _when_ you fast\u2026\u201d Not _if _you fast, this is one of the many indications that fasting is a part of a healthy spiritual life.Forty days might seem like an arbitrary number and an incredibly long time to go without social media, video games, sweets, or whatever you\u2019d decided to abstain from. However, the number itself is symbolic of many meaningful events in the Bible. Noah spent 40 days and 40 nights at sea during the great flood, Moses led the Israelites through the wilderness for 40 years, and perhaps the most direct connection to our fasting for 40 days is that Jesus Himself fasted for 40 days before starting His earthly ministry. The period of forty days is not only symbolic, it also gives our fasting ample time to adopt prayer and meditation on the realities of the cross as a way of life long after Lent has ended. It\u2019s a time of renewal, refreshing, and restoration. Just as God used 40 days to prepare His people for greater blessings or teach them valuable dependence upon Him_, God uses these forty days to shape our hearts and renew our minds to find our greatest satisfaction in Him for whom our hearts desperately long for._It\u2019s worth reiterating in no uncertain terms that _Lent isn\u2019t just about what we aren\u2019t doing._ The focus of this season isn\u2019t to actively avoid certain things, but rather _it\u2019s the active pursuit of God and a willingness to give up good pleasures in order to get ultimate pleasure in God. _The end goal of Lent is to be sanctified and intentionally pursue God in preparation of Easter Sunday, wherein we celebrate the resurrection of our risen King, Jesus. The greatest purpose for Lent is to prepare our hearts for the day that we as Christians celebrate the day Jesus rose again, proving the defeat of sin and death, thereby giving eternal hope to whoever repents and believes in Him for salvation. We cultivate our souls towards a meaningful celebration of this day by not only abstaining from certain food or temporal pleasures, but by actively feasting on the Word of God. In Matthew 4:4, when Jesus was tempted by the Devil during His fast, He answered temptation with a deep theological truth, \u201cMan must not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\u201d And in the very beginning of John\u2019s gospel, he makes very clear in verse 14 that Jesus Christ is the word of God in the flesh. The irony in this time of fasting is that it is also a time of feasting on God\u2019s promises, encouragement, and truth that we find in the Bible. When we read the Bible, we meet our daily spiritual needs and learn all that Jesus is for us. Our fasting and feasting reminds us of our reliance upon Jesus for our survival and joy. The forty day celebration, ending in the exaltation of Jesus\u2019 resurrection from the dead, is really a celebration of our faith in Christ until the day comes that our faith becomes sight.Written by Jama Javier"

        "body": "Many of us think that sharing the Gospel should be done by missionaries in some part in Tanzania. I hate to burst your bubble, but that is not true.**EVERY Christian is called to go out there and serve\u00a0Christ.**> Mark 16:15 says,> \u201cAnd He said to them, \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201dYou might not be able to go to an exotic island to spread the message, but the small things you do in your daily life can make a lot of difference in God\u2019s ministry.\u00a0_We should be ready to verbally speak about Jesus._A small prayer for a beggar on the road, the five minutes you take to help a blind man across the street, or even a few pleasantries with the check-out girl that you see every day. These small gestures can be a bigger plan in bringing more souls to His kingdom._Here are 5 simple ways to share the Gospel:_1. Your TestimonyLet\u2019s get one thing right. Your story is not the gospel. But your story can incorporate the good news of the gospel._- Tell them about your life before you accepted Christ__- Describe how your eyes were opened to His truth__- Talk about how the forgiveness of Christ has changed your life!_This is one of the easiest ways to share the gospel. Everyone loves a good story!2. TextingYes Yes. We all love it. We text all sorts of things in today\u2019s world\u200a\u2014\u200afrom meme\u2019s to quotes to random cat videos.But why not send a few Gospel lines as well? Go ahead and take some time off every day to send God\u2019s message across, all with the touch of a button!3. Set A Good ExamplePeople watch what you do. Even when you think they aren\u2019t watching. So pay close attention to what you say and do. Even refraining from gossip or bullying someone can make a difference in how someone looks at you and your faith.4. Carry Your Bible EverywhereThere are spare moments throughout our day, but we mostly choose to do other things with our time.But if others see you meditating on His word, they get curious. It also shows them that you go to His word regularly and place the Bible above everything else. You never know when this could spark a conversation.5. Let Your Light Shine BrightThe way we live our lives is also witnessing to people.> Matthew 5:16 says,> \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\u201dTreat people with kindness and respect. We can share our faith in the way we act and speak. Don\u2019t ever be walking/talking contradictions. When we stand for righteousness in this cruel world, it works miracles.> Always be ready to share the gospel. Preaching it to the world is not an option, but the duty of every Christian."

When our lives lack joy, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve let go of the \u201cGood News of Great Joy\u201d first declared to the shepherds the night Jesus was born.>Knowing Jesus is really the essence of great joy. Not the new car, the perfect marriage, or the corner office. Jesus is the source of true happiness.Jesus is more interested in relationship rather than rules, because when people focus on following rules they tend to become self righteous kill-joys, like the Pharisees in the Bible. Jesus wasn\u2019t a kill-joy, Jesus was fun! He was so happy that all the kids in town wanted to be around Him.The question for us is \u201cAre we like Jesus?\u201d Do we get the party invitations, or do people avoid us because we suck the life out of the party with our seriousness?When we share Jesus, if we lack joy, we are not displaying the attribute that made Jesus so loved. He is the most revolutionary person to have ever lived, and if people can see Him for who He truly is (joyful and so much more), their lives will be forever changed.**Take this as your daily challenge: Does my level of joy match the \u2018Good News of Great Joy\u2019 Jesus gives us?**"

You could almost say that evangelism is discipling someone to the point of salvation.**Community is essential to our development as Christians.** Without it we don\u2019t fully develop or function into the people God intends for us to become. Directing people to participate and engage with other spiritually healthy Christians is paramount for their personal growth and relationship with God.Try to direct someone to a community with people who can inspire, journey with, and engage with them in deep and honest conversation. Our faith lies at the centre of our lives, so let\u2019s ensure new Christians have the opportunity to learn from the wisdom and passion of mature believers.Additionally, if they are genuinely seeking answers and you feel you can\u2019t answer them, offer to connect them with someone who can\u200a\u2014\u200ayour pastor, an Alpha Course or invite them to church with you.Be bold, invite people into community- you will never get a \u201cyes\u201d if you don\u2019t ask."

        "body": "Many modern Christians consider temptation and sin as just a normal part of everyday life. However, Paul made it clear in his letter to the people of Ephesus that\u00a0_our battles are beyond what our eyes see and our bodies feel_\u00a0(Eph. 6:12). We do not go against the physical but rather the\u00a0spiritual.\u00a0It\u2019s not just the instrument itself but the spiritual attacker who is the root-cause of all wickedness. No tangible weapon or object can ever protect us from the schemes of Satan and his lynch mob.But the Bible instructs us to take up the \u201cFull Armor of God\u201d:**BELT OF TRUTH**\u00a0(Eph. 6:14)One of the schemes of the enemy is filling our minds with lies and deceit, distorting our faith. In fact, deceiving or lying is the primary weapon of Satan, who is known as the father of lies (John 8:44). He convinces believers of lies that attack our viewpoint of who God is, our identity in Christ, and the truth of the Bible. Only the Lord\u2019s truth can ever set us free from the lies of the one who deceives. Securing ourselves with the Belt of Truth can keep us from these wrong beliefs that leads to a wrong way of living.**BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS**\u00a0(Eph 6:14)The breastplate is what protects our vital organs, including the heart. Christ\u2019s righteousness is what protects and guards our hearts from all the accusations and worldly labels thrown by the enemy. Yes, it is\u00a0_the righteousness of Jesus_and not the deeds of men or even ourselves that we consider righteous. Jesus came as a perfect sacrifice for our sin so that we could be made righteous in the eyes of the Lord.The righteousness imputed to us is for the sake of being viewed as sinless, for we represent the One who is blameless, Jesus.**SHOES OF READINESS GIVEN BY THE GOSPEL OF PEACE**\u00a0(Eph 6:15)Ancient soldiers made sure that their feet were well covered to protect them from adversities and the environment, allowing them to travel far. As we keep our feet shod by the readiness provided by the Gospel of peace we will be able to prepare ourselves from the trials and obstacles Satan will place in our paths. And having protected by it, peace will be the one to keep us from the discouragements attached with the devil\u2019s tests.Remember, the gospel is for everyone, not just for the unbelievers. Preach the gospel to yourself often. These shoes will bring us further as we proclaim the Gospel to the world.**SHIELD OF FAITH**\u00a0(Eph. 6:16)Our faith is the foundation of our relationship with our Heavenly Father. The day we accepted Jesus as our Lord and Savior was the day we placed our faith in Him. Paul emphasized in verse 16 that in all circumstances we should take up the shield of faith. In all circumstances where Satan will try to throw us darts of doubts and lies, our faith will shield us from its consuming fire. The shield of faith will be our protection that will save us from death.**HELMET OF SALVATION**\u00a0(Eph. 6:17)Having a\u00a0_total assurance_\u00a0of the salvation and forgiveness we received from the Lord protects us from the confusions and discouragements of Satan. It will fight the confusions of the validity of our salvation and solidify us against any discouragement that we will never get to be with our Heavenly Father. That\u2019s why wearing the helmet of salvation will protect us from these confusions and discouragements and will give us the certainty that we are saved and forgiven.**SWORD OF THE SPIRIT**\u00a0(Eph. 6:17)Armor won\u2019t be complete and a soldier won\u2019t be ready to go to the battle without a weapon. The Lord has provided us the weapon we need to fight the schemes of the enemy through the sword of the Spirit\u200a\u2014\u200aWord of God. In Hebrews 4:12, the author described the word of the Lord as\u00a0_living_\u00a0and\u00a0_powerful;_\u00a0and\u00a0_sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword.\u00a0_Even during the time when Satan was tempting Jesus, He, the Messiah, has used the Word of the Lord to strike each of the devil\u2019s attacks. We should always have to equip ourselves of the Word of the Lord through meditating on it day and night. This will protect us and keep us from the strikes and blows of the enemy.Remember, as we take up the Full Armor of God, we should not neglect the\u00a0power of prayer\u00a0as well. Paul said in verse 18, that we are to pray to the Spirit at all times, with all prayer and supplication. It\u2019s through prayer that we ask strength and guidance from the Lord. It\u2019s a way for us to also be in communion with the Lord as we face our battles.Satan and his army may be good at throwing their attacks, but having been clothed by the Full Armor of God, no fatal blows can ever destroy us. We have to be watchful and alert of the schemes of the enemy. And always remember that our battles are not against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of the wickedness in the heavenly places (Eph. 6:12).Spiritual warfare is real, and not fantasy. Every day is always a battle. So take up the Full Armor of God!Written by Carlos Panganiban"

What do we do when we have such doubts?_We turn to God! Many of you may say that you called out to Him, but haven\u2019t heard anything back._Let me tell you something, because of the busy lives we make for ourselves, we might end up hard of hearing God\u2019s voice. There are many reasons you may not be able to hear Him.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at some:**1. Our Voice Is Louder Than God\u2019s**As a child, I loved throwing tantrums. I knew that if I yelled and screamed at the top of my voice, I would eventually get my way. While screaming, if my parents tried to talk to me, I would scream louder to tune them out. We could be doing this to God. We may not yell and scream, but we doubt His intentions for us. By this we are telling him He\u2019s wrong.> We can\u2019t hear what God is saying if we are the only ones doing the talking!**2. We Ignore God**This happens when we are conscious of His will for us, but choose to avoid and ignore the calling.We ignore because: It may change our whole life. We may not be able to do the things we love anymore. We may think we are not worthy to do His calling. We may be scared.Whatever the reason that little voice inside your head is saying, is not from God. God wants us to listen and respond to His calling.\u00a0_Completing His will is the only thing that can bring us true joy and fulfillment._**3. We Don\u2019t Recognise God**We don\u2019t hear God when we fail to see His doing. There\u2019s a famous story called \u2018The drowning man\u2019.A town was evacuated due to a flood. An old man refused to leave his house because he had faith that God would save him. He sat on his roof and prayed to God.A man came by on a rowboat and asked the old man to jump in._\u2018No, God will save me\u2019, he said.__A motorboat passed by and they requested him to come with them.__\u2018No, God will save me\u2019, he said.__A helicopter flew by and saw him. \u2018Grab the rope\u2019, they said.__\u2018No, God will save me\u2019, he said.__He eventually drowned.__At the gates of heaven, he saw God and asked,__\u201cLord, I had so much faith in you, why didn\u2019t you come to rescue me?\u201d__The Lord replied,__\u201cMy dear child, I sent across a rowboat, a motorboat and a helicopter. Why didn\u2019t you use them?\u201d_Sometimes, like the old man in the story, we may fail to recognize His calling.> Now that you know how to listen to God\u2019s voice, go on and tune in to His frequency!"

All of these experiences are worth sharing!Talking with others about your personal relationship with God is two-fold. Firstly, it shows God\u2019s character and secondly, it opens the opportunity for a God conversation to take place.Our relationship with God is a huge part of what keeps us growing in our faith, so it makes sense that it should be the thing that calls others to pursue a relationship with God for themselves.We often grow the most when we see other mature Christians model a healthy and vibrant relationship with Jesus.\u00a0**We can be a blueprint for others who don\u2019t yet know God, exampling to them what it looks like to have real friendship with God.**"

        "body": "We all live in the raging war the moment we decided to accept Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Savior. We are no longer on the side of the enemy but on the winning side of our Savior and because of that we are succumbed to be the target of the enemy to draw our hearts away from Jesus.> \u201cFor our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places\u201d> Ephesians 6:12This is a head to head battle much like wrestling. Though we may feel the intensity of our battles through circumstances or other people we have to identify who the real enemy is; the real source of conflict and the sphere of influence where they have the power to operate and utilize.Many times we are tempted to take this battle lightly but the reality this battle is as real as the devil himself. To deny the existence of the devil is a flat rejection of the Bible\u2019s divine inspiration. The Lord said that eternal fire was prepared for \u201cthe devil and his angels\u201d (Mt. 25:41). He is Satan, the adversary; he is the devil, our accuser\u200a\u2014\u200athe enemy of God and man. He is our enemy, the serpent, the dragon, the always-tempting one, the deceiver, the father of lies, a murderer from the beginning, ruler of this world, and prince of the power of the air.Throughout history we can clearly understand the warfare through the devil\u2019s actions and the raging war to take us away from God\u2019s lovingkindness. In the garden of Eden, the serpent tempted Eve to doubt God thus brought mankind the curse of death. At the stable, he hoped for the death of the infant Christ. In the wilderness, he tempted Jesus to abandon His mission. Even hours before the salvation of mankind at the garden of Gethsemane, he hoped that Jesus would forsake mankind due to betrayal and humiliation.Even Jesus Christ himself was not exempted from the reality of this battle. He was human just like you and me but He was able to conquer because He stayed strong in the Lord. For He is convinced that the battle is the Lord\u2019s; a perfect example that we too can be victorious against the enemy.But are we fully convinced with our mind and hearts that we are on the side of victory when we live lives that are still defeated?Yes\u00a0, The battle is the Lord\u2019s but we are called to be His soldiers and as soldiers of the Lord we are called to put on the full armor of Christ. But do we also do our part in equipping ourselves for what lies ahead of us. Are we really ready for the battle ahead of us or are we still on the comforts of denial in the reality of this battle and stay in the sidelines of being \u201csafe\u201d Christians?Accept the reality that we cannot live comfortably in this world because we are not of this world. Ask yourself where do your eyes last laid on? Does it glorifies or magnifies your Savior? How about the last song you listened or how about your thought life? Have you already killed your annoying boss an hour ago? Or is there a particular sin that you keep on committing? Maybe experienced that feeling like you are enslaved and just cannot let go.The reality is,\u00a0**the hardest battle actually starts within you.**\u00a0What goes on in your head when you are alone? Remember, Jesus was tempted by the enemy as He is praying alone in the wilderness. That is why we can never be complacent with our Christian walk. The assurance of protection against Satan\u2019s attack is only possible if we put on the full armor of Christ.> \u201cI have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d> John 16:33Whatever struggle or battles you are going through, may it be your personal battle against immorality, depression or pride, you are assured that you can be victorious over that because of what Jesus Christ has done. But you have to choose Jesus over all these and say no to the weapons of the enemy against you.Put on the armor of God, and Satan cannot defeat you for our great God and Savior the Lord Jesus Christ has been victorious, having conquered him who had power over death, that is the devil. Christ Jesus has the keys of death and hades.Take heart, fellow soldiers, for victory is already won.Written by Mariane Detera"

        "title": "2 Convictions of #BattleReady Christians",
        "body": "If you have ever had the opportunity to spend time with Christians from varying backgrounds, denominations or bents, you quickly realize there are those who remember they live in victory (through Jesus), and those who have forgotten.Those who have forgotten seem to be reactive to life and its battles and those who remember seem to be proactive to life and its battles.> When we know whose we are, who we are, and the position of our lives because of those 2 things, we naturally become Christians of strong conviction.Convictions require us to decide what\u2019s right ahead of time. They\u2019re not based on what feels good or seems right in the moment. Rather they are the unmovable foundation upon which our lives are built.The Bible character, Daniel, was a man of God who knew whose he was and who he was. In turn he was a man of strong conviction and someone who knew how to face the varying physical, mental and spiritual battles of life. There are many things we can learn from the life of Daniel and the convictions he held.##### Here are 2 Convictions of Battle Ready Christians\u2026##### 1. Scripture MattersThe Bible contains the very words of God written down. God still speaks into our lives through scripture. We learn of who He is and how He acts. We learn what saddens His heart and what makes Him laugh. Without the Bible, we have no compass for our life on mission.In the story of Daniel, an Angel refers to the bible as \u201cthe Scripture of Truth\u201d ([Daniel 10:21](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Dda%2B10%3A21-21)). Elsewhere the Bible is called \u201cthe sword of the Spirit\u201d ([Ephesians 6:17](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Deph%2B6%3A17-17)) and a weapon that is \u201csharper than any two-edged sword\u201d ([Hebrews 4:12](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Dheb%2B4%3A12-12)). Scripture is both a defensive weapon as well as an offensive one. It can deflect an attack as well as inflict an attack.Deception is one of Satan\u2019s key strategies ([Revelation 12:9](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Dre%2B12%3A9-9)). For a Christian, knowing Scripture is essential. It\u2019s like a surgeon knowing how to operate, or a musician knowing how to play a song. It\u2019s a nonnegotiable. We simply can\u2019t face life each day without feeding, nourishing, and equipping yourselves with the word of God.> If we cut the Bible out of our lives we are guaranteed to become a casualty of war. If we carry the Bible into our battles we\u2019re sure to gain the upper\u00a0hand.##### 2. Prayer\u00a0MattersPrayer is powerful! It is the confession of our dependency on God. Prayer is saying \u201cGod, I need you\u201d in a world that says, \u201cI need no one\u201d. Prayer is an opportunity to tap into God\u2019s power.The best way to face the front line of battle is on our knee\u2019s in prayer. Prayer is like bringing a gun to a knife fight. No wonder the devil wants to keep us from engaging in prayer at all costs. When we\u2019re in prayer, the devil is defeated.As far as the ultimate war is concerned, we can\u2019t lose. Jesus dealt the defeating blow while on the cross ([Colossians 2:14\u201315](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Dcol%2B2%3A14-15)). That means that nothing can take us away from God\u2019s love and plan ([John 10:28](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Djoh%2B10%3A28-28)). But you can lose some of the challenges along the way. That\u2019s where prayer comes in\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s where Daniel entered the battle. Daniel understood that his battle was bigger than he could face on his own. So he didn\u2019t. Daniel tapped into the power of prayer. He revealed his dependence on God, whose battle it is.Are you battle ready? A life on mission requires us to be strong in scripture and prayer. It\u2019s interesting that after Paul listed the armour in\u00a0[Ephesians 6](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblestudytools.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Ft%3Dniv%26q%3Deph%2B6%3A1-24)(which includes the Bible, the sword of the spirit)\u00a0he then mentioned prayer. Why? Because even when we are well equipped for battle, we\u2019re still dependent on God."

Were you on your own all that time?\u201dReiterating what they have said shows you were listening. Asking an associated follow up question shows that you care about what they said and care about them.Avoid the temptation to preach, rattle off a sermon, or try to fix their problem.

What if it\u2019s a doorway into the destiny that God has for you, where you become an agent of change for His Kingdom?I think I\u2019m beginning to understand this concept. It took this situation to help me understand\u2026> Recently, someone did something in the traffic of my daily commute that really got to me. (Unfortunately I still fall prey to road rage sometimes\u2026 Hmm, I am working on\u00a0it.)I\u2019ll spare you the details, but the incident left me feeling really annoyed. I had sped up to avoid a dangerous collision (courtesy of other terrible drivers) and at the same time I passed a speed camera\u2026 Yep!I don\u2019t know what my exact speed was, but I assumed I had just been booked for doing the right thing. The other person (the person in the wrong) realised what had happened and just laughed at me, as I corrected my speed.I was fuming! Sometimes people just have a way of pushing my buttons.

I could let the thought of a speeding ticket irk me for weeks or I could use this as an opportunity to forgive.> Firstly, I had to let it go and forgive them. Then I had to pray. Not about the ticket. but for that person. How much was one person\u2019s eternity worth to God? I\u2019m assuming, a whole lot more than a silly speeding\u00a0ticket.So I began to pray that this man would find Jesus is a wonderful and powerful way. That his whole life would be abundantly blessed from a connection with God, and his family would be blessed because of his testimony. I didn\u2019t know his name, so I called him Bill. Every time that fear of getting that speeding ticket in the mail came, or the frustration of injustice rose up to play on my mind, it was my queue to pray for Bill.I prayed for his kids (assuming he would have some one day, if not now), and I thanked God that the fruit of Bill\u2019s life as a dad and a friend of God would be a long legacy of people who follow hard after God. It was as though every time the negative thoughts tried to encroach on my mind, I\u2019d turn and use them for advancing the Kingdom through prayer. I can\u2019t fully describe to you how freeing it felt.> I\u2019d found that the ultimate way to battle offence is to pray for your enemies, and those who hurt and misuse\u00a0you.I\u2019m learning that prayer for others gives me mastery over anger and un-forgiveness, allowing myself to return to joy faster. It\u2019s like your under fire, but you have the ability to snatch the bullets right out of the air and fire them back.> Each time we forgive and pray for those who wrong us, we take\u00a0ground.##### I thought it would be hard, but it\u2019s actually energising. I just was looking at the whole situation the wrong way. I was missing an opportunity.Now I may never meet that man in this life, but one day I\u2019ll see the fruit of that prayer and fully realise why Jesus was so adamant that we listen and practice this radical idea in\u00a0_Matthew 5: 43\u201348__\u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\u201d_Written by: Judah Kampkes"

And so we cannot deny that man would be considered His greatest creation.The Psalmist emphasizes this more on Psalm 139:14,\u00a0_\u201cI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

It wasn\u2019t just an experience and an understanding; there was a relationship between him and God that enabled him to have such experience and understanding.It says in Genesis 1:27 that when God created us, He created us in His\u00a0**own image**. The basis, the very benchmark, of our being was patterned after the wonder of God\u2019s being and character. While sin changed everything, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that we were meant for greatness up to the standard of who God is. But there is still a big difference between the Creator and the created:\u00a0**we were meant to be great, but He is already great**. He knows our very being, from the physical makeup of our bodies, to the quirks of our personalities, to the cracks and pains of our hearts.And because we have a Creator, not only does He own everything but also, we are dependent on Him for everything.And so we are reminded that in God\u2019s ability and power to create us in our first birth, we were meant to experience His all-knowing power and ever present love for us. When God takes us through the pilgrimage of life, calling us to our second birth (or when we become born again), we know that in His power to create us, He also has the ability to save us.When we accept Jesus\u2019 salvation and Jesus in our lives, we become closer than ever to the creation that we were meant to be. And in our continuous sanctification, we understand more what it means to be righteous and how great really God is.

When Nokia kept making their products better, I found myself switching from one phone model to another. I lived and breathed Nokia.When Apple introduced the iPhone, I remember telling my sister this:\u00a0_I will never switch to iPhone. Nokia is the phone for me._Fast forward to a few years\u200a\u2014\u200aI owned an iPhone, a Macbook Air, an iPad and an iMac. I switched. I ate my words. I eventually admitted that I changed.I realized that there was a part of me that didn\u2019t want change. I was so confident that I wasn\u2019t going to change my conviction regarding my mobile phone preferences, but I did change, so even if I am a loyal Apple user now I do not want to say that I will never switch to Android. Change is always present, change can always happen.In the Bible, the most popular change for me would have to be the Apostle Paul.> 15\u00a0> Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners\u200a\u2014\u200aof whom I am the worst.\u200a\u2014\u200a1 Timothy 1:15Paul murdered and persecuted Christians, but during one act of mercy he became a new person whom God used mightily. He became an Apostle and dedicated the rest of his life planting churches, preaching the Gospel, and worshipping God.In my online ministry, I encounter a lot of people asking for help and counsel, yet they believe they cannot change and they feel so depressed and discouraged. No matter how much counseling I give, they have come to the conclusion already that there\u2019s no hope for them to change.This is where our responsibility as believers come in. We need to faithfully preach the Gospel. We need to tell people that in Jesus Christ, one can truly change and be given a new heart, a new life. In Jesus Christ, grace abounds like living water and one can be redeemed and be set free from the bondage of sin. Why can this happen?\u00a0**Because we have an immutable God. We have a God who is unchanging.**\u00a0And Jesus? He\u2019s the same yesterday, today and forever. The God who is unchanging has and will always have the ability to change a person\u2019s life.Ezekiel 11:19 says this:> And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,Believers, don\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to tell people about the God who never changes.

I came to realise that in all of that there was little time for me to simply be Jesus to someone or share Jesus with someone. This is a conundrum many Christians face.> Time is precious, and we live in a busy world. We have to rethink the way we share\u00a0Jesus.When I\u2019m working hard, I get tunnel vision. I become so focused on the task that I miss the people. I dare say others would be the same. Our challenge is to remember to allow time for interruption. For me, instead of driving straight to work, I stop for a coffee at a local cafe. It\u2019s a chance for a conversation to happen and relationships to form. I buy food at the supermarket rather than online, so I can ask the cashier how their week was and engage meaningfully.> Allowing time for interruptions is a simple attitude shift from \u2018I don\u2019t have enough time\u2019 to \u2018how can I make best use of the time I\u00a0have?\u2019So, go be awesome.

These recurring words I\u2019ve heard since I was a child\u200a\u2014\u200asalvation, grace, and surrender\u200a\u2014\u200afinally found its way into my heart. These became foundations of a single-minded pursuit of a relationship with God. For moments of struggle, I was pointed to a powerful thought that essentially changed how I responded to circumstances: _How do I react in a Christlike way?_ In more familiar terms, what would Jesus do?We have two ways of looking at this. Being Christlike gives us this blessed assurance that **identifying with Christ\u200a\u2014\u200ano longer I, but Christ who lives in me\u200a\u2014\u200agrants us an esteemed standard for all our actions. **Constant sanctification then becomes the goal until our last breath. Another perspective, which we fail to note, is that **it is impossible to, ultimately, be like Christ.** He is inexhaustible, omnipotent, and sovereign, and we are not; His limitlessness was never designed for our human selves to attain. I would like to focus on the latter.We become frustrated because we want answers to be revealed to us, when these are not ours to know. We want His secret will in every aspect of our lives for decision-making to be easier. We bite off more than we can chew and question boundaries which have been set to protect us. We clamor for authority and self-sufficiency. Do these sound familiar? **The good is not withheld from those who love Him, unless the withholding _is_ the very good.**How then do we respond to the unshakable truth that God is so unlike us? More so, how does this change the way we live? Are we paralyzed by insecurity knowing that even on our best days, we fall short of the glory of God? Do we cower in fear and self-pity while we set aside our gifts? Do we hold on to misplaced shame? Do we pridefully run towards His unattainable attributes and puff up when we do good deeds?God is infinite, incomprehensible, self-existent, eternal, and omnipresent, among others. Jen Wilkin once wrote,\u00a0> \u201cOur primary problem as Christian women is not that we lack self-worth, not that we lack a sense of significance. It\u2019s that we lack awe. Awe helps us worry less about self-worth by turning our eyes first toward God, then toward others. It also helps establish our self-worth in the best possible way: we understand both our insignificance within creation and our significance to our Creator.\u201dIsn\u2019t this awe-inspiring? We now look at our perfect God\u200a\u2014\u200aunstained, faultless, and complete\u200a\u2014\u200awho says we are worthy of His presence. He is an immutable God who needs no one yet chooses us and retrieves the single lost soul out of a hundred.**The more we become aware of His attributes, the more we have a deeper understanding of ours. **We position ourselves in humble reverence when we discover that our bodies, our platforms, our gifts point towards His glorification. We take comfort in surrender because we worship an all-knowing and unchanging God who takes control of all things._No way are we exempted from being Christlike. _Ephesians 4: 22\u201324 presents this struggle so beautifully, \u201cPut off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.\u201dThe God I serve is so different from me, and He designed it that way. I praise Him that I continue to be sought out when I choose to run away. I praise Him that though my performance changes day by day, His devotion remains steadfast. I praise Him that this relationship isn\u2019t dependent on a fair exchange because even if I listed down every good thing I\u2019ve done, it can never repay and warrant for my salvation. I can rest in this Love which covers my sin\u200a\u2014\u200amy failure, apathy, and rebellion\u200a\u2014\u200aand embraces every part which is so unlike Him.We have hope because we worship the God to whom hope belongs to.

        "title": "Why We Need A Saviour",
        "body": "It has been said that the gospel is offensive. Scandalous even. Over the years, the gospel has been a reliable source of hope, unchanging in unpredictable times, and constant in an evolving world. And yet, the message of and about Jesus has been consistently branded as offensive all throughout history. No matter what culture, age, or economy, the gospel has brought outrage to those who hear it. How can something that is often referred to as the \u201cgood news\u201d be so controversial?What gives the good news about Jesus its cutting edge is the nature of the message itself. In it are two truths that are hard to swallow and are often rejected upon hearing. The gospel is the proclamation that all of humankind has failed at its purpose to bring glory to God by faithfully living for Him. To make matters worse, we not only fall short of living a life pleasing to God but, we\u2019re actual rebels against Him. But instead of giving us our just punishment for our failures, God shows His love for us by sending a sacrifice on our behalf. That sacrifice is Jesus. God gives us a way to be absolved and forgiven for all our sin and rebellion at cost of the life of His own Son. Alongside the gospel is a call to turn away from our sin and the things that displease God and live our lives for Jesus, fully trusting that His work on the cross is enough to grant us love and forgiveness from God.If you\u2019ve never heard about Jesus before, or if you have a short attention span especially on Sunday mornings, a lot of those words and phrases might have gone over your head. I don\u2019t blame you. Sometimes churches use decidedly religious words that seem so specific to Christianity that we become unsure of its meaning. Since it\u2019s so easy to zone out when we hear those key religious, or \u201cChristianeze\u201d words, I\u2019d like to take the time to simplify things in order to understand why the gospel is so important yet at the same time so offensive to those who hear and understand it today. Hopefully, you walk away with a better understanding of why we so badly need a Savior and how that need is completely satisfied in Jesus Christ.**NEVER GOOD ENOUGH, NOT GOOD AT ALL**If I asked you if you thought you were a good person, what would you say? Most people wouldn\u2019t find it difficult to admit that they thought they were good. Especially when they compare themselves to other people who, in their opinion, have done much worse things in their life. And even if you\u2019re one of those people who grew up in church and learned to answer this question with a resounding \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a good person.\u201d there\u2019s a chance you still\u00a0_believe\u00a0_you are. That\u2019s not a surprising thought, after all. However, the problem of this belief that we are good people comes from having a subjective standard of what \u201cgood\u201d actually is. When we think of our morality, that is, whether we\u2019re\u00a0_good\u00a0_or\u00a0_bad_, we often consider our standing in society. But when if when it comes to the gospel, which is a message from God, we\u2019re asked to think of our standing in terms of a higher standard. Not ours, but God\u2019s. This is where it gets offensive. The Bible tells us that we\u2019re not good, at least not by God\u2019s perfect standards. At this point, we could get into the 10 Commandments, take a look at how many of them we\u2019ve broken, and realize that if these commands were actual laws we would be in deep trouble with the authorities. But instead of that, I\u2019d like to take a different route in an effort to see just how far we fall short of how God has called us to live.**HOW BAD CAN WE BE?**There was once a prophet named Jeremiah, and God had called him to tell the people to turn from their sinful ways and return to loving Him and following Him. In Jeremiah\u2019s prophecies and proclamations to God\u2019s people he reveals the true nature of our problem called \u201csin\u201d.**12 Be horrified at this, heavens;  \u00a0be shocked and utterly appalled.  \u00a0This is the Lord\u2019s declaration.13 For My people have committed a double evil:  \u00a0They have abandoned Me,  \u00a0the fountain of living water,  \u00a0and dug cisterns for themselves,  \u00a0cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.**- Jeremiah 2:12\u201313In these two verses are a profound explanation of how sinful we actually are and why it\u2019s so bad. Sin isn\u2019t limited to lying, lust, or murder. Sin is the act of abandoning God and seeking satisfaction in other things that ultimately leave us empty. Jeremiah paints a picture of God as a fountain with vibrant flowing water, and yet we foolishly choose to abandon Him as we try to dig out our own source to drink from, a source which is inherently flawed and unable to satisfy. This means that not only do we sin when we do wrong against other people, but we sin whenever we try to be independent from the God who made us and knows what\u2019s best for us. Jeremiah not only challenges us to rethink our views of sin but of our view of God as well. When we move from thinking of God as an abstract idea of absolute power to thinking of Him as a loving Father who cares greatly for us, we begin to see the true evil in abandoning Him. Sadly, we\u2019re all guilty of this. It\u2019s not easy to hear that you\u2019ve committed a great evil, or admit that you\u2019re no better than the worst of men. And that\u2019s just the first truth of God\u2019s message for us today.**THE GREATER OFFENSE**All of that being said, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the most scandalous part of the gospel. As hard as it is to hear that we\u2019re not as good as we thought we were, or hear that we\u2019re actually not good at all, what\u2019s more unbelievable is how God responds to the great evil we\u2019ve committed.What would you do to someone who\u2019s constantly wronged you? How would you judge someone who\u2019s done nothing but continuously break the law?Would you die for them?That\u2019s probably the last thing you\u2019d consider doing, but that\u2019s precisely what God did for us. In what might be the Bible\u2019s most popular verse, we\u2019re told that16\u00a0\u201cFor God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJohn 3:16In light of the fact that we\u2019ve lived as rebels against God, the most outrageous proclamation of the gospel is not that we are sinners deserving of punishment and death, but that God sent His son Jesus to bear that punishment and die on our behalf so that we could be forgiven for all that we\u2019ve done. If you think that it\u2019s unfair that\u2019s because it is. The gospel of Jesus Christ isn\u2019t about fairness but mercy, it\u2019s not about wrath but grace. It\u2019s a great exchange depicted in 2 Corinthians 5:21 \u201c\u00a021 He made the One (Jesus) who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\u201dThe scandal lies not in our sin, but in God\u2019s grace made available to us through Jesus Christ. Our sin was put on Him, and the obedient life He lived is put on us. It was an exchange of the holy for wretched, the just for the unjust, the perfect for the imperfect.**THE LIFE WE CHOOSE**These twin truths, that we are sinful and that God saves sinners, demand a decision. We can choose to reject what God has said about us\u200a\u2014\u200aand in doing so reject God Himself\u200a\u2014\u200aor we can choose to put our trust in Jesus and live for God. The one thing that we cannot do is ignore what we now know. The path that follows Jesus is an invitation to know God in this life, and experience it anew. It promises a life to the fullest, with purpose and joy, ending in eternity with a Heavenly Father. The path that rejects God only offers a life that promises our hearts greatest desires while being unable to deliver. It is filled with false meaning, empty achievements, and unending separation from God. Alongside the offensive gospel is the question of how we will respond to God\u2019s great love.Written by Jama Javier"

Not only does it take over your thinking, but it also decides how you invest your time and spend your money. Whether you like it or not, love changes you; love marks you.As Christians, our lives have been marked by the love of Jesus. He is the most revolutionary person who has ever lived, and an encounter with His love will leave you changed.> An encounter with Jesus will ruin you, in the best way possible. If it doesn\u2019t\u2026 I question the encounter.Personal encounters with Jesus have radically changed the direction and focus of peoples lives. Consider the Apostle Paul in the Bible. He happily murdered Christians, yet after an encounter with Jesus, He became one the world\u2019s greatest evangelists and wrote half of the new Testament.Encounters with Jesus have inspired others to stand up against inequality, given fresh passion for people groups, ignited global movements and radically changed local communities.> The love of Jesus ruins your natural propensity towards a life revolved around self and sets you on a course to live for others. You cannot be marked by love and live for\u00a0self.True love does not operate selfishly. In fact, a defining mark of Christianity is our love for others and the dedication we give to seeing others reconciled to Jesus. Something is wrong when a person claims to love Jesus, but fails to love others.The love of Jesus in you compels you; the love of Jesus for you convinces you; and the love of Jesus at work in you changes you. As you are compelled and convinced by the love of Jesus, you willingly let it change the way you think and act. Once you are compelled, convinced and changed by love, you can do nothing but be committed to the beautiful work of reconciliation.**A life marked by love is a life committed to reconciliation. The reconciliation of others to Jesus. The question is\u2026 Are you marked by love?**"

If you aren\u2019t growing as a Christian, I\u2019d say it is time to check the health of your relationship with Jesus, because healthy things grow.

It says in Luke 2:52:> \u201cJesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man\u201dInterestingly this sentence is just about all that is said about Jesus in the years leading up to His public ministry. Yet, this short sentence says quite a lot.Have you ever taken time to assess how you are going in yourself? Are you growing in wisdom, stature and favor? Some elements of spiritual growth seem unquantifiable, yet others are actually very practical and quantifiable.Here are a series of questions worth asking yourself. They cover multiple areas of life, each of which come back to our personal relationship with Jesus.#### 10 questions worth asking yourself\u2026##### Am I investing in\u00a0myself?- This is a personal growth question.##### Am I genuinely interested in\u00a0others?- This is a motive question.- If people mattered to Jesus, they should matter to us.##### Am I doing what I love, and loving what I\u00a0do?- This is a passion question.- If you go to work only to fulfill process and function, you are effectively retired.- Passion gives you advantage and drive.##### Am I investing my time with the right\u00a0people?- This is a relationship question.- Jesus only chose 12 people, and He had an inner circle of 3.##### Am I staying in my strength\u00a0zone?- This is an effectiveness question.- You don\u2019t have to be a jack of all trades.- Focus on what only you can offer to a situation.##### Am I taking others to a higher\u00a0level?- This is a mission question.- Longterm influence is determined by the seeds you sow.- Your mission is to add value to others.##### Am I taking care of\u00a0today?- This is a success question.- Success is determined by your daily agenda.- Are your habits utilizing your time or wasting it away?##### Am I taking time to\u00a0think?- This is a leadership question.- A minute of thought is greater than an hour of talk.- Taking time to think allows you to live life purposefully.- You author your life by clearing your schedule for thinking.##### Am I developing leaders?- This is a legacy question.- Are you committed to developing successors who go beyond yourself?##### Am I pleasing\u00a0God?- This is an eternity question.- Is your conscience clean before God and man?How did you go with those answers?

The concept can be summarised by the notion of\u00a0_Emanuel_\u00a0in the Bible, meaning \u2018God with us\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200apresent and active. Not just around us like a cosmic force, but a person in us\u200a\u2014\u200adistinctly different from us, yet integrated so complexly into our being that two thousand years of study has only rendered more questions than answers.3. An entity that takes up residence within the human soul, that inspires, guides, and cultivates us to become more and more like the giver of the Spirit\u200a\u2014\u200aJesus Christ. Even more mysteriously, our own person is reborn by the presence of this being inside of us.> The Holy Spirit may be the most ingenious and unique component of Jesus\u2019 ministry.Traditionally, leaders of movements, inspire, teach and demonstrate others to a common pursuit. But God is no traditional leader. As God always does, He goes a step further than any other. Leaders can cast a vision, and motivate their followers. But only God can give us an inner power to accomplish the challenge set before us by sending His Helper\u200a\u2014\u200athe Holy Spirit to empower and guide us in His divine purpose. No other teacher, leader, guru, Imam, has ever delivered on this promise. But Christ ensures we are not just transformed by the hearing of His words, but also by his own person: His Spirit at work in our life.##### Jesus Empowers\u00a0UsIt can be easy to skip this. Before the disciples were released to share the message, they had to wait for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now we don\u2019t have to wait around in an upper room, but we do have to understand that without the Holy Spirit, we don\u2019t have a hope of fulfilling the mission.> The Holy Spirit gives you the power to advance the Kingdom of God the way Jesus did, and the counsel and wisdom to wield the power with His integrity and compassion.The crucible of the fire of the Holy Spirit burning in a person\u2019s heart will oust sin and habits of brokenness like a hot pan of cooking oil spits out drops off water. Self-help and discipline may get you to the gate of a life on mission, but the holy spirit in you will break open the door and storm the castle to take hold of God\u2019s inheritance for your life.The compelling of the Holy Spirit was enough to get the disciples out the door and on with the commissioned task.Being armed with the experience of Jesus and an awareness of His message, it can be easy to skip the necessity of the Holy Spirit in accomplishing in our own strength what God intended we fulfil by the Spirit.A life on mission without the power of the Spirit is like trying to win a car race in a vehicle without an engine. It\u2019s like a troop without any weapons\u200a\u2014\u200aan impressive effort, but useless at taking ground. It has all the appearances of a winning car, but there is no movement.**A Christian without the Holy Spirit active in their life is like a car that doesn\u2019t move\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s ceases to fulfil it\u2019s purpose.**We need the Holy Spirit assisting our proclamation of Jesus like we need air in our lungs to make our words have any volume.

It is the beginning of an incredible journey and every journey starts with a step.**Here are 5 important steps to set you up for a win:**#### Step 1. Read the\u00a0BibleIf you\u2019ve ever opened a Bible and felt a little lost, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not your typical book! The Bible consists of 66 books written over 1500 years by 40 different authors. The entire Bible is inspired by God and written for our instruction. A good place to start is with the book of John in the New Testament. It explains how and why God truly loves us. It also explains who His son Jesus is.#### Step 2.\u00a0PrayGod loves you and loves hearing from you! Communication is important in any relationship and prayer is just that, a conversation with God. He really wants to hear from you. You can tell Him anything and everything, and if you listen, you can hear Him speak to you too. You don\u2019t have to speak or act a certain way. Just pray however you feel comfortable.#### Step 3.\u00a0WorshipWorship is the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration towards God. It is defined by the priority we place on\u00a0_who_\u00a0God is in our lives and\u00a0_where_\u00a0God is on our list of priorities. There are lots of ways you can worship, like telling God how awesome He is by praying, singing, or meditating on what He said in the Bible.#### Step 4. Connect with other ChristiansIt\u2019s really important to meet up with other people who follow Jesus too. There are a few great ways to do that. We recommend joining a church and having a discipleship group to learn more about God and what it means to be a follower of Jesus.#### Step 5. Share your\u00a0faithIt\u2019s good news! Tell it, sing it, post it. Telling other people about your life changing decision is really important too. This is called sharing your testimony. There are lots of ways to share your testimony online and offline. Posting something to social media is a great way to start. Write it down and start sharing."

Not spiritual conversation, just general conversation. If you have that under control, you are in the prime place to share your faith online.**Here are 8 great ways to drop the God-bomb on social media:****1. Comment on a post**  \u00a0People often turn to social media to vent. Search by hashtag, and you\u2019ll find them. Respond with kindness and mention that God cares about them. Then see where the conversation goes.**2. Write your testimony  **\u00a0Blog your story about how Jesus has changed your world, and post it on medium and Facebook.**3. Run a Facebook live Q&A\u00a0  **This one is for those who love the camera. Kick off the conversation around a faith related topic, and allow people to ask you questions.**4. Share an interesting article\u00a0**Sites like \u2018Desiring God\u2019 or \u2018Relevant Magazine\u2019 have fantastic thought-provoking articles.

Offer prayer**\u00a0  If someone is sick or in pain (emotional or physical), trust that Jesus wants them healed more than you do, and ask them if you can pray via message or over the phone.**6. Promote an event**Whether your church has a new people\u2019s service, or are you hosting a BBQ at your home, you can invite people into community. Inviting people to come, eat and connect with other Christians is an amazing way to impact lives. Creating a Facebook invite is a fantastic way to being intentional and reach out to others if you\u2019re struggling to catch up with them in person.**7. Sharing a video**Sharing a clip with a God theme is a great way to start conversations online. Some people share by posting to their wall or tweeting it publicly, others share the video in a private message. Video has a way of communicating on a deeper level, and holds people\u2019s attention long enough for them to take in the message and consider it.**8. Private message someone ** \u00a0You may have seen a friend post about something happening in their lives, or they may have just been on your mind. Get in contact. Ask them how they\u2019re doing, and turn the conversation towards God. Having private chat conversations about Jesus online can seem limiting at first, and somewhat impersonal.\u00a0**But what we\u2019ve found is that people can be more open and honest when chatting online than in person.**\u00a0  It is a powerful way to share the Gospel, and you can do it with anyone in the world who has an internet connection."

        "body": "We\u2019ve all felt it. The sudden panic of being caught by surprise. Everyone standing around waiting for your answer. The conflict inside your head. The pounding in your chest!> Peer pressure is like losing a battle that hasn\u2019t even\u00a0started.But that\u2019s not true. It is very much possible to fight this fear and stand up for what you believe in. Here are a few ways to overcome peer pressure and be your true self!**Know Yourself Inside-Out**The key to this is to stop, think of what you believe in, what standards you want to live by and who you want to be as a person. Once you\u2019ve figured this out, start living by it.God has given us the power of choice. So if you don\u2019t start choosing the right decisions for yourself, others will pick the wrong one for you.**Know Them Inside-Out**> \u201cShow me your friends, and I\u2019ll tell you who you\u00a0are.\u201dI vaguely remember my grandpa making this statement to me over the years. I usually responded by rolling my eyes at him. But now I realize, there is nothing truer than that! You\u2019re friends define who YOU are. Now you\u2019re thinking, \u201cBut they\u2019re my friends, what can I do?\u201d> Here\u2019s what you can do:> - Find out if they love you for who you are, or who they want you to be.> - Figure if they will still hang out with you if you say \u201cNo\u201d to the wrong things.> - Ask yourself if you can be open and honest about your faith and dedication to God with them.Once you feel validated that they are true friends, you can be the greatest version of you with them!**Avoid What You Know Is Bad**We all have our weaknesses. And we know in which areas we may be tempted more. So let\u2019s try to not put ourselves in a situation where we can get swayed by other people.1 Corinthians 15:33 says,_\u201cDo not be deceived: \u201cEvil company corrupts good habits.\u201d_Admit it. We all know a little bit about WHO influences us to do the wrong things. But we argue that they are our \u201cfriends\u201d. But if we keep in the company of such people, it becomes difficult to serve God and be faithful to Him.**Always Be Ready**You never know when or where peer pressure may strike. So be prepared every day to face the challenges that come. My personal prayer for this comes from Psalm 118:6\u201cThe Lord is on my side;I will not fear.What can man do to me?\u201dSo go ready for the battle with God as your defense. When you live for Him alone, He becomes your shield and refuge. No amount of pressure can break down what God has formed inside you!Written by Prashant Andrew"

        "body": "Many years ago, the city of Brooklyn in NYC was a rundown and cheap part of town. The low cost of living attracted those rich in creativity, yet poor in pocket. Artists began making Brooklyn home. They decorated the streets with art and music, turning desolate neighborhoods into beautiful character filled communities; giving hope to many for many years.In turn, Brooklyn became popular. So popular that the affluent and art loving middle-class decided to make beautiful Brooklyn home. Their actions and presence pushed the cost of living up and the pocket poor artists out, bleeding the community dry of its heart.These days Brooklyn is a thriving high-end hub of entrepreneurship, business and design; yet amidst the high-end hustle and bustle lives a remnant of artists.This is made known by a small yet powerful piece of graffiti sprawled on a wall saying: \u201cArtists Still Live\u00a0Here.\u201dSomehow, despite the growing cost of living, they managed to hold their ground; determined to stay in the city they helped create. At the core of this remnant is a knowledge of what Brooklyn was founded on, a passion to ensure it is never forgotten, and a desire to believe for more in the future.It is easy to make comparisons between this story and the ongoing narrative of Christianity being pushed out of the neighborhood. Society has thrown out many of the Christian values which have woven the very fabric of humanity and decided to set up shop selling cheaply crafted morals. They have bled society dry of its heart. Crime is high, terrorism is rampant, suicide is normal and divorce recommended. You don\u2019t need to be a Christian to agree that the future looks grim and seemingly hopeless (if it were to keep playing out the same way).Now, more than ever it is essential we let society know that \u201cHope Still Lives\u00a0Here!\u201d**It is essential we let society know that there is a large global remnant of Jesus followers, with a knowledge of societies founding values, a strong passion to ensure they are never forgotten, and a desire to believe for more in the future. **More compassion, more humility, more kindness, more love, more hope and more of Jesus in society.Being a Jesus follower may push us to the edge, but we don\u2019t have to be pushed out. Sure we may be in unusual and unique situations, feeling penned in by pressures to conform. Sure the costs associated with faith may rise, but this should not stop us from believing, sharing and declaring that hope is well and truly alive.In fact, our unwavering trust in Jesus, despite odds and opposition will itself declare loudly to a hopeless world that \u201c_Hope Still Lives Here!_\u201dLet\u2019s continue to be beacons of love and safe havens of hospitality in a world void of true love and hospitality. Let\u2019s stand tall as moral lamp posts in a dim-lit moral-free society. Let\u2019s be the rare smiles, meaningful conversations and long hugs to those used to angry faces, shallow conversation and cold shoulders.**Let\u2019s continue to live on mission and do all we can to show the world that hope still lives here, and His name is Jesus!**Then Jesus said, \u201cI am a light (Hope) to the world and those who embrace me will experience life-giving light, and they will never walk in darkness.\u201d\u00a0  John 8:12 (TPT)"

        "body": "\u2018The Gospel\u2019 is a phrase thrown around often in Christian circles. To explain the Gospel, it is important to understand what it is. Let\u2019s unpack it quickly\u2026The word \u2018Gospel\u2019 literally means \u2018Good News\u2019 and it is mentioned 90+ times in the Bible. Specifically speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the good news about Jesus. The story of who He is and what He did.##### Let\u2019s break it down so you know how to explain it in 3 simple\u00a0steps\u2026#### 1. God\u2019s\u00a0DesignGod created the world. We can see beauty, purpose and evidence of design all around us. It is impossible to ignore. Just look the intricate design of plants, the way the moon influences the tide, or the ever changing colors in a sunset. The Bible tells us that God originally designed a world that worked perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200awhere everything and everyone fit together in harmony. God created us for a purpose. He created us to know Him and to enjoy Him; to live and bring glory and honor to Him.**_Read:_** Genesis 1:31, Psalm 19:1, Ephesians 2:10#### 2. Our Brokenness (Sin)If we look around at society, it is easy to see that humanity is not bringing glory to God. Rather there is a brokenness in the world. We see it in the evil of terrorism, we see it in war, violence, abuse, deceit and betrayal. In ignorance to God, we could search high and low for the reason of the brokenness, but the truth is, beneath it all, the problem is spiritual. Really, we are the problem. We have not lived for God, we have not followed His rules, rather we have made our own. We have not valued a relationship with Him. The Bible calls this sin. Sin is running from God, trying to do life our own way. Sin is taking the title of God and putting it upon ourselves. It is because of sin that we as humanity have become hostile, not only towards God, but towards others. The Bible says the consequence of sin is death.**_Read:_** Romans 1:25, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Proverbs 14:12#### 3. The Solution\u00a0(Jesus)Brokenness leads to a place of realizing a need for help; a remedy, some Good News. God, because of His mercy and great love for us, did not leave us in our brokenness. He sent His Son, Jesus as a solution to our sin problem. Jesus, came to us, lived a perfect sin-free life (exampling life by God\u2019s design) and willingly chose to die in our place to pay the penalty for our sin. He then defeated death and rose to life. He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Simply hearing this good news is not enough, we must act on it and admit to our sinful brokenness, ask God for forgiveness and stop trusting in ourselves. This is when we can begin to understand God\u2019s original design for our lives and the lives of others._Read: John 3:16, Colossians 2:14, Mark 1:15, Ephesians 2:8\u20139There you go! A simple (but not too simple that you have to re-explain it) version of the Gospel. Remembering the 3 stages and the key parts of each stage will help you feel confident to share the Gospel at any moment.**Why not try explaining the Gospel today?**"

It\u2019s tempting to sink your teeth into whatever grimy secret your friends are talking about. We\u2019d rather be \u2018in the know\u2019 than be left out.But gossip can be very damaging. Instead of building people up, it tears them down. That is not what we a Christians should be doing.**Gossip Can Be Devastating To The Other Person**Proverbs 12:18 says,\u201cThere is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, But the tongue of the wise promotes health.\u201dThe fundamental element of every relationship is trust, but gossip betrays that trust.

        "body": "One statement can really ignite a crowd either in a positive or negative way.President Duterte, who has been involved in many controversial issues ever since he rose to power, has again created a lot of noise by calling God\u00a0_stupid_. Here\u2019s a quote from his actual statement:_\u201cAdam ate (the fruit of knowledge), then malice was born. Who is this stupid God?\u2026 You created something perfect and then you think of an event that would tempt and destroy the quality of your work. You were not involved but now you\u2019re stained with an original sin\u00a0\u2026 What kind of a religion is that? That\u2019s what I can\u2019t accept, very stupid proposition.\u201d_When I first heard it, I asked myself \u201cWhat in the world is he doing? Why is he saying these things?\u201d Looking at his track record ever since he became President, he\u2019s fond of saying controversial statements that will cause every journalist and tv news anchor to report immediately, causing everyone to react and comment and spread every opinion possible on social media -even after he apologized today.As Christians, how should we react to this? How can we see the positive out of this seemingly negative issue?##### There is HOPE in this Messed Up\u00a0WorldPresident Duterte touched on original sin which destroyed God\u2019s perfect creation and that is the reality:\u00a0_we live in a world tainted by sin_. It gets worse and worse as the days go by. But\u00a0God knows what He\u2019s doing.> His purpose was to create a world in which He will be able to manifest His full\u00a0glory.The hope we have in Jesus Christ is key. The world that we currently have was allowed by God to fall, but there is redemption through Jesus Christ, and one day this world will be restored to its original perfection (the book of Relevation is a whole another topic to explain this one).##### Our Leaders NEED\u00a0PrayerIt\u2019s so much easier to complain and express our personal opinions on certain issues. This Duterte statement really turned my Facebook newsfeed into a thread of anger, complaints and opinions. Here\u2019s my take\u200a\u2014\u200aPresident Duterte, when he finally meets his creator, will be accountable for his actions.> As Christians, we are to have the burden to pray for our leaders, not just to govern our country the right way, but to also experience God\u2019s saving grace that will reflect on their leadership.It should always be our desire to pray our leaders\u2019 salvation.\u00a0We battle negativity with God\u2019s Word and prayer.1 Timothy 2:1\u20134 says this,\u00a0_\u201cI urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. This is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth.\u201d_##### It\u2019s a Call to\u00a0ACTION!Satan is tactical. As it says in John 10:10,\u00a0_\u201cThe thief comes only to kill and steal and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\u201d\u00a0_Satan will all that he can to distract us from the Great Commission that God has set before us.> It can be easy to get caught up in these debates but the frenzy is a great starting point to talk about God\u2019s truth -not in opposition but in\u00a0love.What Satan meant for evil, God will mean for good because He is sovereign and there is already victory in His Name. Our God is not stupid. He knows what He is doing.Now what will\u00a0_you\u00a0_do?"

        "body": "Growing up, I didn\u2019t really like debating with people. I would resort to keeping quiet and not waste my time on what I believed were meaningless topics to debate on.Christianity has been taking a lot of persecution on social media lately when it comes to topics on Jesus and controversial issues like homosexuality and suicide, and church stand on politics to name a few. It\u2019s easy to share a conviction online through a Facebook post. We can look at it as an opportunity to share our faith. But when people start commenting and disagreeing, it can become chaotic. Most of the time, different people jump in to react, making your post become a hot thread of unwanted debates.Social media has broken barriers. It has become a playground for a lot of people to express opinions, thoughts and ideas very openly. So as Christians, how should we respond to people to those who want to debate with our convictions and stands we freely expressed online? How do we manage conversations that can turn in to debates?##### **1. Acknowledge And\u00a0Respect**The first thing you need to do is acknowledge the person who commented on a certain issue with a different opinion from yours. To acknowledge it to show respect. You can say something like this: _\u201cHi ______\u00a0, thank you for sharing your opinion on this. I acknowledge your views are different from mine and I respect that.\u201d_ You can start from there.##### **2.****Transfer From Public To\u00a0Private**After you acknowledge and show respect, you humbly make a request to transfer the conversation privately to avoid creating unnecessary buzz in other people\u2019s newsfeeds. You can continue on with something like this: _\u201cI find our difference of opinions very interesting and as someone who also wants to learn from other people, would it be okay if we transfer this conversation privately so we have more room to communicate better?\u201d T_he point here is to make a request to transfer the conversation privately without disrespecting the person. Moving the conversation to a private space allows you and the person to share ideas at a more personal and vulnerable way as compared to continuing it on a public forum.##### **3.****Show Genuine Love And\u00a0Concern**\u00a0Once you actually start conversing further, always remember to be in an attitude of Christlikeness\u200a\u2014\u200ashowing genuine love and concern for the person. We have that desire to convince them reconsider and understand the truth of Jesus, but _there are times when these conversations end up with you both agreeing to disagree._ When that happens, that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t need to be sad about it. But here\u2019s a challenge: Offer to pray for that person. Ask him or her if there\u2019s anything you can pray for. It is rare for someone to reject an offer to be prayed for so make sure to end the conversation by doing something that would surprise them with your Christ-like behavior.Philippians 2:3\u20134 says this, _\u201cDo nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.\u201d\u00a0_##### It\u2019s not about proving that you\u2019re right; God is the one who opens convicts the hearts of people and make them see the truth. Our role is to faithfully proclaim the truth and genuinely love people at the same\u00a0time.Don\u2019t let a debate hinder you from being gracious and loving."

A six-year-old or a sixty-six-year-old; everyone hits the stress button at some point or the other.Stress is something that tears you down emotionally, spiritually and physically. Not having great friends can cause us to feel anxious and worried. A broken home can be stressful. Not being able to finish a task on time is nerve-wracking. It can hit us when we\u2019re tired, ill, or if we don\u2019t feel comfortable somewhere. The causes are endless.When people are overcome with stress, the world offers tons of solutions to ease the stress levels. Alchohol, drugs, yoga, and medication are some the ways people try to de-stress. But this isn\u2019t going to get us far.For a believer, stress can take on many varied forms and shapes. It can be as subtle as backsliding from your faith or having a full-fledged panic attack.How can we deal with this the right way?**Admit To God That There\u2019s A Problem**When you know that there is stress in your life, the fastest solution is to recognize that there is a problem.It\u2019s never easy to own up that everything is getting too much for you to handle.Psalm 32:2 says,> \u201cBlessed is the one whose sin the LORD does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.\u201d(NIV)God wants you to be honest with yourself and with him. A humble confession will make all the difference in starting to de-stress.**Pray Your Stress Away**When you experience anxiety, burden or pressure. Turn to the Lord in prayer. He is your ever-present help during trouble.Philippians 4:6\u20137 says,> \u201cDo not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ\u00a0Jesus.\u201dHe makes a promise to us with these verses. The promise is to give us peace beyond what we can fathom.**Spend Time Meditating, Praising And Thanking God**When we dwell in the Lord\u2019s word, we realize that there are many promises from Him that can take away our fear and worry.Some examples are:Matthew 11: 28\u201330John 14: 272 Peter 1:3All of them talk about the inexplicable peace that comes only through Christ.Praising God through my stress has worked out great for me! Every time I sing his praises, my worries seem to vanish away. So next time you feel stressed, try listening to your favorite worship song and sing along! Life can be complicated and confusing. And as humans, we tend to fall into the battle of stress.So if you\u2019re in the valley of stress right now, you know the way out!Written by Prashant Andrew"

        "body": "The Philippines has been known for the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d, the government\u2019s call to take down drugs once and for all in the country.Security measures have stepped up, more law enforcement officers are being called, and rehabilitation programs are being implemented in local barangays to ensure that the drug users will develop change for a better life.Ever since the administration has started this campaign, more than 1 million drug users and pushers have already surrendered and that number will continue to grow.As a Christian, how can we do our part in bringing light into the lives of these people? How can we help in bringing the Gospel into the lives of these people who desperately need Jesus Christ?**Here are some ways you can get involved\u2026**##### **1. Pray\u00a0**Solutions start in the place of prayer, hearing from God, and praying what is on His heart. He\u2019s always got the answer, we just need to hear Him to find it.##### **2. Get\u00a0involved**_SIPAG_ (SImula ng PAGasa) is a Ministry for drug dependents surrendering to the government. God has opened doors of opportunities for the church to minister to them, their families, the police and the local government officials. _Christ\u2019s Commission Fellowship_ has been in the forefront of this campaign, and if you want to volunteer, you can check out the SIPAG Facebook page.I tell you, this movement needs all the help it can get and it doesn\u2019t matter which church you are from.##### **3. Create a community**Some of the major reasons why people turn to addiction is because they are looking for hope, purpose, identity, and a sense of belonging. What kind of community can you help to create in your area of influence? Who can you join with to see this happen? Think of common interests\u200a\u2014\u200abasketball, biking, running, mountain climbing, etc. Think of activities that you can create to help these people enter new and refreshing environments by having a space for fellowship and spiritual growth. Think of it as a discipleship group that you can create to help these people into a brighter path.Remember, \u2018as you go\u2019, the spirit of God goes with you Isaiah 61:1. Be confident, the Good News that is inside of you will shine and as you obey the promptings, God will change lives through you."

Think back to a time when God answered your prayers or showed you He is real or did something miraculous.It\u2019s useful to have God stories like these on hand, so you can use them in a conversation when the opportunity presents itself. A great purpose for your testimony is to create a desire in the hearts of others to say: \u201cI want that!\u201d> Focus on what God has done and can do, and do your best to avoid Christianese words.Make sure they understand what you are saying and ask what they think about it.

But we\u2019ve all failed at something, haven\u2019t we? An exam, making the basketball team, keeping up time, helping a friend.This feeling of failure is familiar to a lot of people, including me. I was never good at facing them. Particularly when I failed to tell people about Jesus. I let the failure wash over me and take over my senses. I felt like I had failed as a believer. Did it do me any good? That\u2019s a no. It\u2019s only later that I learned that my failures were just a learning tool. It didn\u2019t define me or my character.So how can we overcome our failures and learn from them?**No Matter What Happens, Never Give Up**We have to see that failures can be advantageous. Learning from our failures and not repeating our mistakes is what God wants us to do.When you fail, no matter the extent, never give up. It\u2019s in the process that character is built. Focus on the process, rather than the destination.**Galations 6:9**> \u201cLet us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give\u00a0up.\u201d**Accept Your Limitations; know your gifts.**God created us, so he knows all of our limitations as well. Have the willingness to endure and the grace to accept that we can\u2019t do everything under the sun, but we can do what He has willed upon us. He doesn\u2019t call you to do something until he equips you to do so!**Hebrews 13:21 (NLT)\u00a0says,**> \u201cMay he equip you with all you need for doing his will. May he produce in you, through the power of Jesus Christ, every good thing that is pleasing to him. All glory to him forever and ever!\u00a0Amen.\u201dGod has given each of us different gifts which we can use to serve Him. That encompasses a wide variety of skills and talents, from baking and hospitality, to communication and media, there\u2019s so much you can do to reach out to those around you and share Jesus! Use your gifts and let your light shine on earth!**Have Faith**To overcome failure, we must believe that God is bigger and greater than it. Faith is what brings victory, over failure!**Hebrews 11:6 states,**> \u201cBut without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek\u00a0Him.\u201dBelieve in faith that God has forgiven you for your failures and that He has a greater plan that you are a part of! Seek out God\u2019s will in your life and He will give you the divine ability to carry it out. Don\u2019t be bogged down by something that you were not even called to accomplish, rather pray about things that God has predestined for you to accomplish.**Look At The Positive Side Of Failure**You read it right. Failures can be hard and painful in the moment, but we must choose to look at the bigger picture. Our most fabulous and patient teachers can be failures.**Isaiah 1:18\u00a0says,**> \u201cCome now, and let us reason together,\u201d> Says the\u00a0Lord,> \u201cThough your sins are like\u00a0scarlet,> They shall be as white as\u00a0snow;> Though they are red like\u00a0crimson,> They shall be as\u00a0wool.\u201dThe Israelites failed to follow God and tumbled into a whole list of failures. But God offered His forgiveness and redemption even then! You have a God who is patient and forgiving with you as a father is with a child.

How in this generation, if there\u2019s a growing trend (fashion, music, art, etc.), we always want to be the first one who wore those set of jeans or listened to that artist before they became popular. Or how about when you have a favorite singer or musician, do you like it when someone else does? Do you always feel the need to point out that you\u2019ve liked this singer \u201cfor the longest time\u201d, and that you\u2019re sure that no one else is as big a fan as you are?

Sadly it hasn\u2019t been effective.> Sharing Jesus is not incidental, it is central to our faith and that calls for more than a silent\u00a0witness.Speaking the Gospel was never meant to be optional when following Jesus. In fact it isn\u2019t even really a task, it should be a natural action out of the overflow of our love for Jesus and His love for others.Yes, people will see our good works and glorify God, but the Bible is clear that\u00a0the story of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection is too good and too important to leave to guesswork.\u00a0We must share, we must speak up.

But in a world that has fallen out of step with the light and turned to darkness, there is always hope\u200a_\u2014\u200aa living hope._In Jesus, we find our hope, light, and our strength (Psalm 62:1\u20132), and while we, as Christians, know this and hold on to this, we don\u2019t always share it. Why? Because **our default, as sinful creatures, is to look out for ourselves first.**Whether you\u2019re afraid, apathetic, feel like you don\u2019t know the Gospel enough to share it, or simply don\u2019t think much about those who don\u2019t know Jesus, it all stems from an attitude that prioritizes yourself above others. If you truly, from the bottom of your heart, want to share the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ to those around you, then you\u2019re going to have to hit that \u201cChange Default\u201d button on your heart.** You\u2019re going to have to stop focusing on yourself and start thinking more of that person who hasn\u2019t experienced God\u2019s love yet.** You\u2019re going to have to get over your fear of rejection, being laughed at or mocked by remembering that Christ Himself was also rejected, laughed at and mocked by many (Isaiah 53:3). If you feel ill-equipped to share the Gospel, you\u2019re going to have to stop relying on your own knowledge and strength and start leaning on the Holy Spirit for help (Luke 12:12).So the next time you come across that friend who you know needs Jesus, don\u2019t let your fear of rejection, offending someone, or whatever else it could possibly be, hinder you.\u00a0##### You don\u2019t need to know everything or have all the answers to share your faith. All you need is how God has worked in your life and the leading of the Holy Spirit to discern how to handle the conversation.Changing our default isn\u2019t easy, but if it is our mission to make disciples (Matthew 28:19), it\u2019s necessary. Not because it\u2019s the \u201cChristian thing to do\u201d, but because if we ourselves have truly experienced Christ\u2019s love, then He will trigger the change in you. Trust that it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13).By Megan Mendoza"

It has been attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi.It is:\u00a0_\u201cGo into the world and preach the gospel, and if necessary use words\u201d_\u200a\u2014\u200aDespite any evidence that Francis ever said this, many Christians have followed this command, ceasing to witness with words and instead replaced it with silence, hoping that their actions will point people to Christ. Sadly it hasn\u2019t been effective.> Sharing Jesus is not incidental, it is central to our faith and that calls for more than a silent\u00a0witness.Speaking the Gospel was never meant to be optional when following Jesus. In fact it isn\u2019t even really a task, it should be a natural action out of the overflow of our love for Jesus and His love for others.Yes, people will see our good works and glorify God, but the Bible is clear that the story of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection is too good and too important to leave to guesswork. We must share, we must speak up. The love of Christ compels us!##### I challenge you to kick silence and speak\u00a0up.I challenge you to share your faith publicly today. That could be to a work mate, on Facebook, or to the attendant at 7eleven. Regardless of who it is to, it is important that you do.> A great way to do that is to simply say \u201cHey, did you know God created you and loves you?\u201d You have now opened the conversation\u2026 let the fun\u00a0begin!All you need to share your faith effectively is a relationship with God, and a relationship with others. Sharing your faith is simply connecting those you know with the God you know. The eternities of those around us can be changed forever, simply because we chose to share Jesus.**People are open to talking about Jesus, they are just waiting for you to start the conversation.**Written by Prashant Andrew"

What do we do when we have such doubts?_We turn to God! Many of you may say that you called out to Him, but haven\u2019t heard anything back._Let me tell you something, because of the busy lives we make for ourselves, we might end up hard of hearing God\u2019s voice. There are many reasons you may not be able to hear Him.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at some:**1. Our Voice Is Louder Than God\u2019s**As a child, I loved throwing tantrums. I knew that if I yelled and screamed at the top of my voice, I would eventually get my way. While screaming, if my parents tried to talk to me, I would scream louder to tune them out. We could be doing this to God. We may not yell and scream, but we doubt His intentions for us. By this we are telling him He\u2019s wrong.> We can\u2019t hear what God is saying if we are the only ones doing the talking!**2. We Ignore God**This happens when we are conscious of His will for us, but choose to avoid and ignore the calling.We ignore because: It may change our whole life. We may not be able to do the things we love anymore. We may think we are not worthy to do His calling. We may be scared.Whatever the reason that little voice inside your head is saying, is not from God.

We Don\u2019t Recognise God**We don\u2019t hear God when we fail to see His doing. There\u2019s a famous story called \u2018The drowning man\u2019.A town was evacuated due to a flood. An old man refused to leave his house because he had faith that God would save him. He sat on his roof and prayed to God.A man came by on a rowboat and asked the old man to jump in._\u2018No, God will save me\u2019, he said.__A motorboat passed by and they requested him to come with them.__\u2018No, God will save me\u2019, he said.__A helicopter flew by and saw him. \u2018Grab the rope\u2019, they said.__\u2018No, God will save me\u2019, he said.__He eventually drowned.__At the gates of heaven, he saw God and asked,__\u201cLord, I had so much faith in you, why didn\u2019t you come to rescue me?\u201d__The Lord replied,__\u201cMy dear child, I sent across a rowboat, a motorboat and a helicopter.

        "title": "4 Ways to Live by Example",
        "body": "There\u2019s no doubt or debate that living a life on mission means that we are to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19). I think, rather, that the questions start pouring in when we think about how we\u2019re supposed to accomplish such an intimidating task. _How do we tell people about Jesus, teach them about His commandments, and then expect them to give their lives to Christ, too?_When I was a young Christian and\u200a\u2014\u200alet\u2019s face it\u200a\u2014\u200aliving a life that wasn\u2019t completely surrendered to Christ, I experienced a lot of frustration and disappointments in my crusade to share the gospel with the people close to me. Despite my gung-ho attitude, people didn\u2019t seem to take me seriously, and when I gave what I felt was godly advice, it was often met with resistance. Because I was still living a double life, one full of willful sin and a life where my belief in Christ was reserved for Sundays only, there was no credibility behind anything I was saying.\u00a0> It was in that season that God revealed something important to me\u200a\u2014\u200athe best testimony that we can show to others isn\u2019t what we say, it\u2019s how we live our\u00a0lives.Sure, our role is to plant the seed and let God do the rest of the work (1 Corinthians 3:6), but to share about Jesus credibly requires** living an authentic Christian life\u200a**\u2014\u200aa life that exemplifies your belief in and commitment to Jesus. If hypocrisy is one of the biggest reasons that people leave the church or are deterred from it, then it ought to be our mission to live in a way that brings glory to Christ.\u00a0In a world that is rampant with disbelief, there are 4 specific ways that you can live by example and start winning souls for Christ:##### Practice What You\u00a0PreachWe can study Scripture all we want, but if we fail to _apply_ the lessons that God teaches us through His word, then all we have is head knowledge. To be salt and light in this world, to live by example, we need to let that knowledge invade our hearts and transform our lives into one that is upright (1 Peter 2:12). We do this through our speech, our conduct, our faith, and our purity (1 Timothy 4:12). Think of it this way, would you, in good conscience, encourage someone to be pure in body and mind if you yourself are not? We must live in such a way that we are beyond reproach (2 Titus 2:7\u20138).##### Find Joy in Every SituationOne of things that makes unbelievers most curious about Christianity, is their remarkable ability of a true believer to find joy even in the midst of trials. A co-worker of mine immediately comes to mind in this case. She was recently diagnosed with cancer and although her future is uncertain given her prognosis, her heart is still joyful. _Because of her love for and belief in Jesus, she is filled with the inexpressible and glorious joy_ that the apostle Peter speaks of (1 Peter 1:8\u20139). It is her joy in the midst of suffering that has caused others to ask her about her faith and paved the way for the gospel to be shared.##### Model ChristlikenessWhen it comes to living by example, there\u2019s no one who\u2019s ever done it better than Jesus Himself. He is the ultimate example of discipleship, because He built His entire ministry around it. At the end of the day, however, discipleship is a _daily modeling of Christlikeness_ to other people, and to model Christlikeness we need to practice humility and selflessness above all (Romans 12:16, James 4:10, Ephesians 4:2, Colossians 3:12). Think about it. Jesus was equal with God and yet He came, in form and likeness of men, to serve (Matthew 20:28) and to die a humiliating death on the Cross for you and me (Philippians 2:8). _If our goal is to be more like Christ, then we ought to mimic His example of humility and selflessness._##### Invest in RelationshipsWe are called to spur others towards love and good deeds (Hebrews 10:24), but, frankly, it\u2019s impossible to do if you don\u2019t have some kind of relationship with the people you\u2019re trying to encourage. For example, as a discipler, I can\u2019t expect any of the girls I\u2019m discipling to actually take my advice to heart nor can I expect to have any kind of influence over of them if we don\u2019t have a relationship to begin with. Spend time and effort cultivating relationships that are built on trust. _Walk life-on-life with these people and the influence will follow._> Living by example isn\u2019t easy. If it were, then we wouldn\u2019t need to rely on God\u2019s strength to do\u00a0it.\u00a0If you\u2019re at that point in your life where you\u2019re discouraged and unsure if you can press on and continue living by example, remember that our **God will strength us, help us and uphold us** (Isaiah 41:10). Where the ideal is lacking in our lives, He will make grace abound (Philippians 4:19).By Megan Mendoza"

When we are born2. \u00a0when we receive Jesus in our lives and acknowledge that He is our Lord and Savior3. \u00a0When we discover what our purpose is.When we think about what it means to have a purpose-filled life, these are the first few things that would probably come to mind: excellence in studies for students, a great career for singles, a wonderful marriage for those who are married, or kids who were raised properly for parents._ Whenever we achieve those things (or whatever purposeful milestones we have for ourselves), we find that they don\u2019t really fill our hearts. _From one stage life to the next, from one achievement to the next, **we keep looking for more. **And that\u2019s because these are all momentary\u200a\u2014\u200anot that they are not important\u200a\u2014\u200aand there\u2019s always the question of, _\u201cwhat\u2019s next for me?\u201d_That must mean that our purpose is geared towards **something that has more value, something that\u2019s\u00a0eternal**.It says in Colossians 1:16,\u00a0_\u201cFor by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities_\u200a\u2014\u200a_all things were created through Him and for Him.\u201d\u00a0_To put it simply: **We were created to bring glory to God. **Our existence and in everything that we do, is for the sole purpose of glorifying God\u2019s Name. He puts us in a specific place, at a specific time, and in a specific season in our lives to reveal Himself and His glory\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s really no other\u00a0purpose.**The created is to glorify the Creator.**If our purpose is this, how then do we live our lives to do so? I believe it starts with our day-to-day life. Our actions, our words, and our life is a glimpse of who Jesus is to those who do not know Him yet. Does your effort towards your studies show excellence, therefore a reflection of the greater things that God has done? Does your attitude towards your boss and peers at work show God\u2019s kindness? Does your marriage show God\u2019s love? Does your communication with your children show God\u2019s patience? Reflect and start (or continue) to live a life that speaks of God\u2019s glory."

She had to undergo a premature labour at five months of her pregnancy. The news of our handsome little boy not making it in this world was devastating and inconsolable. I had so many plans for this boy and now he is no more. I began to question God. Why did God allow this to happen? Why should we alone go through this difficulty? Why is God quiet in my suffering? These questions kept bothering me over and over again and I could not come in terms for a long time. As Christians, we can get plagued by these questions whenever we go through situations like these. Here are three suggestions that helped me through my trials and hope this will help you.**We live in a fallen world**When God created us, the world was perfect: no sickness, no suffering, no death, until the perfect couple sinned. We took the created world down with us. The whole world was cursed; it too is fallen and suffers because of our rebellion. Human sin resulted in disease, decay and death across creation. Perfect creation was stained and broken by our sin; we live in an imperfect and fallen world where diseases kill and disasters happen randomly. Lots of suffering is the result of living in an imperfect, fallen world.> \"In the world you will have tribulation.\" These are Jesus' own words written in John 16:33.If you have lived very long you will agree this is true. Common to all our journeys is personal suffering. We experience troubles in our relationships, our health, our safety, and our financial security. Suffering affects as we watch others we love or the world that God loves suffer. Becoming a Christian does not mean we will not suffer; in fact, Jesus' own words remind us that we will have troubles. The question before us is not \"Will we suffer?\" but \"How will we handle our suffering?\"**Suffering Can Bring Us Back to God**We must understand that God does not actively will for our suffering and evil that people experience. Rather, God works through the circumstances of our suffering to bring about a greater purpose in our lives. In the Bible we read that Joseph when meeting with his trembling older brothers, calmly response to their fear:> \"Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God? You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.\" (Genesis 50:19,20).Our futile minds can never grasp the vastness of what God intends. The best possible way is to submit under God's mighty hand and allow Him to work it out for us.**Suffering deepens faith and holiness**Hebrews 12 tells us that God disciplines his children through suffering. His aim is deeper faith and deeper holiness.> \"He disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness\" (Heb. 12:10). Jesus experienced the same thing. \"Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered\" (Heb. 5:8).For us there is not only the need to have our obedience tested and proven deep, but also purified of all remnants of self-reliance and entanglement with the world.But there is good news. Jesus Christ stepping in\u200a---\u200afreely giving his life on the cross for his broken creation in order to demonstrate the supreme love of the Father\u200a---\u200amay be the best possible world we can hope for. For in that world, pain and suffering is not an unremitting brute fact of existence but something that the God of both the cross and the resurrection can turn into his greatest victory."

Jesus touches the blind man\u2019s eyes and asks \u201c_Do you see anything?_\u201d He answered \u201c_Yes, I see people, but I can\u2019t see them very clearly.

It can be uncomfortable, confronting, and easy to begin hoping that someone else will step in to help them through it.But then we look at Jesus, and we see Him being fully present, fully engaged, and fully available for people no matter the circumstance.> In your friend\u2019s darkest hour, you can be\u00a0Jesus.[Anna Mannarino](https://relevantmagazine.com/author/annabelcher/), writer at\u00a0[Relevant Magazine](https://relevantmagazine.com/), speaks from a place of personal experience when sharing advice on this topic. After suffering through depression herself, here is what she has to say to others who may not know how to help their friends through depression, but want to:**1. Don\u2019t\u00a0Judge.**_You will feel frustrated with me. You will wonder why I can\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200aor don\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200aget better. You won\u2019t understand my limitations. You will call and suggest a fun activity, hoping to cheer me up, only to find that I just can\u2019t. It won\u2019t make sense.__But please don\u2019t judge me. I\u2019m already judging myself harshly. I\u2019m having trouble understanding myself, too. I\u2019ve heard happiness is a choice and I\u2019m responsible for my own emotions, but right now I\u2019m having difficulty figuring out how to apply those principles.__Pray that your heart would be full of grace toward me. If judgment remains in your heart, I will probably sense that. It will probably come out, because \u201cout of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.\u201d What a blessing if the overflow of your heart is grace._**2. Don\u2019t Tell Me to Believe Things I Already\u00a0Know.**_I know God is good. I know He works everything for good for those who love Him. I know I should find joy in God.__And I know it is good to be reminded of these things, but please tread carefully. I know these truths should thrill my soul, but right now my soul is wounded. It isn\u2019t a lack of faith or unbelief. Please don\u2019t imply that my spiritual deficiencies are the cause of my depression.__Not a sparrow falls to the ground without God\u2019s knowledge, but sparrows still fall. God works all things to the good for those who love Him. But He still allows His saints to suffer. And He doesn\u2019t always tell them why._**3. Learn to\u00a0Listen.**_I will say things that are not true, things that need to be refuted. I will express my pain in wrong ways.__I need you to tell me true things, but first I need to know that I have been heard. I need grace when I say, \u201cI\u2019m the most miserable person alive!\u201d Understand that right now, I probably do believe that.__Don\u2019t immediately shoot me down with, \u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Instead, let me know that you\u2019ve heard me with something like, \u201cWow. You must feel pretty bad right now. You feel pretty alone, like no one else can really understand what you\u2019re going through.\u201d__After actively listening to me, you can attempt to correct my faulty thinking, with something like, \u201cI know you feel terrible and alone and not understood. But you aren\u2019t alone. I may not completely understand, but I love you and I\u2019m here for you, and that won\u2019t change. And, what\u2019s more, God loves you, and whereas I might fail you, He never will.\u201d By this point, I may actually be able to hear you, because I feel heard._**4. Don\u2019t Try to Fix\u00a0It.**_You can\u2019t. There is nothing you can say that can convince me to be happy, and most attempts will lead to frustration on both sides._**5. Sit With\u00a0Me.**_I\u2019m going through a dark time right now, and what I need most is someone who is willing to sit with me in my darkness. Hold me while I cry.__Only after you hear me and hold me will there be any chance that I can hear the truth._**6. If You Give Advice, Back It Up with\u00a0Support.**_Be very careful if you feel like telling me I need to do something. You may be right, but please understand how impossible everything feels right now. Tell me to do something only if you are prepared to hold my hand through it.__I know exercise will help me feel better. But tell me to exercise only if you are prepared to come over, roll me out of bed, pick out my exercise clothes, choose my exercise program, prod me every step of the way and do my laundry when it\u2019s over. And don\u2019t look discouraged when I\u2019m not better after a week of this. It\u2019s helping, but change is slow.__If that is too much commitment, don\u2019t give the advice. I am weary of hearing what I should do without the strength to do it. I don\u2019t need cheap words. I need someone who is willing to sacrifice his or her time and comfort to something they truly believe will be helpful to me._**7. Pray For Me and With\u00a0Me**_There are several reasons why this is good:__\u00a0There are the standard biblical reasons about when two or more come together in Jesus\u2019 name He will be there.__Then there\u2019s the practical reason:__\u00a0If you pray with me right now while you\u2019re thinking of it, both of us know that your well-intentioned promise to pray at some vague time in the future won\u2019t be forgotten when you get home and are overwhelmed with life\u2019s little urgencies.__Finally, there\u2019s the relational reason:__\u00a0Hearing you plead with God for me gives me another opportunity to feel heard. When I hear you tell God what I\u2019ve told you, I know you have paid attention. You may not completely understand my emotions, but when you understand enough to tell God, my feelings of isolation begin to recede.__Like everything else, don\u2019t expect immediate fixes from prayer. We serve a powerful God, a God who heals, but as far as I can see, He usually heals depression gradually.__To be my friend while I am suffering from depression is a heavy burden. And while I am in the middle of it, I will be just as likely to lash out at you as to thank you. But when I can, I will thank you with my whole heart.__Originally published at\u00a0_[_relevantmagazine.com_](https://relevantmagazine.com/life/how-help-friend-fight-depression)_\u00a0on May 13, 2014._"

        "title": "The Path of Most Resistance",
        "body": "I am yet to experience anything of true worth to be easy. In fact, things of true worth with eternal outcomes often take you on the path of most resistance.We can easily justify the reasoning for our large Goliath size battles in life, but how do we explain the simple, obvious and seemingly easy things that are far harder than they should be?The Bible references questions from Christians as to why non-Christians seemingly prosper easily whilst being a Christian is hard? I don\u2019t believe this challenge just refers to maintaining an overall sense of belief, but also getting through each day; the struggle is real.Resistance is a great way of describing this challenge. Being a Christian isn\u2019t like hitting a daily wall that grinds everything to a halt, (God ALWAYS provides a way through walls), but it can feel as though the little things are harder than they should be.I was pondering on this recently and felt God show me that to be a follower of Jesus means we have a real and active enemy who is out to kill and destroy.> Whether we like it or not, we daily put ourselves on a collision course with the enemy when we are doing things of worth in God\u2019s\u00a0Kingdom.So, as Christians we have an active spiritual enemy/resistance attempting to wipe us out. Non-Christians are not a threat to the enemy. They are on their own wide path of self-destruction that doesn\u2019t require anyone stopping them!The enemy has an active posture of evil toward Christians, but God\u2019s posture toward Christian and non-Christian alike is one of love and grace. His sole intention is relationship and He is willing to forgive and forget at a moment\u2019s notice.> God is not an enemy of sinners, He is a friend of\u00a0sinners!I often thought resistance only came from atheists or those opposed to God, however, in my experience it can come unknowingly from those closest to me. More often than not, even from people on the same side. It\u2019s also very likely that at times I have been inadvertently a cause of resistance to other Christians too.The best example of this is on a Sunday. It\u2019s always the day that feels the hardest. It\u2019s always the day when the kids wake up with a sniffle, or the day my wife and I or the kids disagree about something; or in a tired state my perspectives seem under attack. I believe this is resistance, the enemy trying everything to stop us as a family going to church because it normally stops once we have showed up anyway.We see Jesus noticing the resistance even in His own disciples, \u201cget behind me Satan\u2019 He directed at Peter, the same Peter which is the rock on which He built His Church!> Jesus promised us eternal life, not an easy life. Walking with Jesus is the narrow path and it\u2019s the path of most resistance.The bible prepares us for all this telling us we will have trouble. It talks about anything to do with the enemy as a \u2018battle\u2019 war. We aren\u2019t told to wrap ourselves in a blanket and get comfortable, we are told to put on armour. It\u2019s not meant to keep us comfy but protect us in battle. Not just the Goliath size battles, but the everyday simple battles also._\u201cPut on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.\u201d _\u202d\u202dEphesians\u202c \u202d6:11\u202c \u202dESV\u202c\u202cI say this to encourage. If it\u2019s tough and the simple seems harder than it should be, don\u2019t give up\u200a\u2014\u200akeep pushing, persevering and keep your eyes on Jesus. We were never called to find the easiest path through which to navigate life. We were call to take new ground, rescue the lost and preach the Good News. This requires the path of most resistance as they are the things that matter most to God! The wide path to destruction is the path of least resistance.> The bigger the battle, the bigger the resistance, the bigger the\u00a0prize._\u201cBut those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.\u201d _Isaiah 40:31, NLTIf you are facing resistance, take courage, you are on the right path. Keep going!"

        "body": "Dan, a passionate Social Worker, chats with us about what it means to him to follow Jesus, to live fearless and how he is a visible portrait of Jesus to his world\u2026> Portraits Series inspiration:\u00a0Jesus is the most revolutionary person to have ever lived, and if people can see Jesus for who He truly is, their lives will be radically changed.\u00a0[Colossians 1:15](http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm), says that Jesus is the visible portrait of the invisible God. Today, in the absence of the person of Jesus on Earth, we as Christians play a vital role in living on mission (through the Holy Spirit) and pointing people to Jesus by being visible portraits of Jesus to our world.# \u2014 FAITH\u00a0\u2014**How long have you been a Christian?**I said a prayer when I was 5 years old, however it has definitely been a lifelong decision to choose to follow Jesus daily and l\u2019m still learning to lay down a lot of junk.**Why did you choose\u00a0Jesus?**I searched in a lot of places that I was told had answers and I still felt empty. It wasn\u2019t until I actually turned around that I realised God still had his arms outstretched and could genuinely satisfy that longing which I kept looking for. Also, He showed a love that would never fail which kept failing in my own life and in the world. I feel like it\u2019s a constant journey for everyone, but I choose Him now from that confidence that I have in His love for me, even when I have run the other way.**Who inspired you to choose\u00a0Jesus?**Definitely my family. I am so thankful for my parents encouragement towards a relationship with Jesus. I saw the joy that came from living their lives for Jesus. There are plenty of people who still encourage me to choose Jesus through the way they live, however I\u2019m a firm believer that you can lead a horse to water but you shouldn\u2019t make him drink, that\u2019s not your job. We can encourage and love and live as examples, but it\u2019s up to God to actually deal with people\u2019s hearts.**What has changed since choosing\u00a0Jesus?**I want to do the classic \u2018what HASN\u2019T changed\u2019 clich\u00e9\u200a\u2014\u200aWhile it is true, since choosing Jesus, I don\u2019t think I wake up and the grass is greener, or the birds perch on my shoulders and I don\u2019t break out in some\u00a0_Disney_\u00a0princess song. lt has been a deep and authentic thing for me. I have a peace that I don\u2019t really know how to explain. I have this genuine relationship with God that isn\u2019t based on wish-list or help-line prayers. I know that I am loved and I have a love and passion for God, life and others that exists beyond what I naturally ever could have. There are also many other things like joy hope, purpose, freedom, etc.##### Why are you a part of a local\u00a0church?I absolutely believe the church is the people not a building. However, I also think there is great value in being part of a local church, not just for the fellowship but also to serve and be unselfish. It\u2019s too easy in our hyper-offended culture to find offence with people and the church, and decide to stop going, or float around and find like-minded crew to connect with. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever what God wanted His church to look like. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for people to be self-focused. I think we need the diversity of church, it grows us, challenges us, encourages us and allows us to serve something better and bigger than just our own interests.# \u2014 FEAR\u00a0\u2014**Is fear a liar?\u00a0Why?**Fear can be healthy and unhealthy. There is healthy fear; like \u201cThat sign says this beach is infested with sharks, maybe I\u2019ll surf at another beach cause I do not want to get absolutely munched!\u201d Or, the fear of God, which is a reverence for who He is. Then there is unhealthy fear, which in many cases can be crippling and really hold us back from living in fullness of life and achieving amazing things. Fear is always driven by the belief that something negative will happen. Fear is a liar when it positions what we are fearful of as higher or bigger than our belief in God and His ability to actually be enough in our circumstance.**What does it look like to live fearless to\u00a0you?**To live fearless is to live out of God\u2019s love. The Bible says perfect love casts out all fear. I would love to live completely free of all fear and only be driven by love!**Who inspires you to live fearless?**Jesus, He was perfect at it! He was so driven by love that fear was useless on Him. In the Bible, people brought seemingly impossible situations to Him, but He was never overcome by fear. He just moved in love and healed them. People would abuse Him, but He continued to speak truth and life and meet the needs of the people with love. The only way they could actually stop Him, despite all the threats was to kill Him. That\u2019s a pretty inspiring love to follow if you ask me.**The voice of God and the voice of fear are both very real. What does it look like to you to live by the voice of\u00a0God?**I think the easiest way to distinguish fear and God\u2019s voice is to take the time to learn to listen. Fear always seeks maximum self preservation. With God\u2019s voice; spend time in relationship with Him, read the word, get to know what his voice sounds like. Learn what is in his heart in the word and being guided by the Holy Spirit. Then when you feel something speaking to you or your being drawn to do something, your already familiar with what fear might say vs: what God\u2019s voice might say. If fear is speaking, you can call it out for what it is and not let it defeat you, if it\u2019s God\u2019s voice, listen and respond. That\u2019s how it looks to me anyway.**How does your faith push you out of your comfort\u00a0zone?**Far out, I\u2019m pretty sure there isn\u2019t an area of faith that doesn\u2019t push me out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m intellectually driven, so just having faith in something beyond what I can tangibly experience or even analytically comprehend is a massive push out of my natural comfort zone! However, I cannot deny the reality of my experience of God to the point of changing my life. With that comes the passion to share this experience of genuine relationship with God, which is another massive step out of my comfort zone.**How would you encourage others to live fearless?**Jump! Seriously, take that leap of faith and follow Jesus\u2019 lead of loving God and others with everything. Stand firm in truth and be authentic! It\u2019s actually so attractive and becoming rarer everyday! Give yourself some grace knowing we\u2019re all on this journey together and will make mistakes, but get up and keep pursuing Jesus!#\u2014 PURPOSE\u00a0\u2014**What do you feel like your specific calling\u00a0is?**To love God and others as best I can. I have a crazy passion for people and particularly young people. I\u2019d love to start something that holistically meets the physical, social, emotional and spiritual needs of communities and their young people around the world. That is what has driven me to pursue Social Work and get involved in helping run community and church programs for young people. But who knows, maybe God calls me to open a fruit store tomorrow, I\u2019m pretty open. I think it\u2019s less about what you do and more about how you do what you do. If I can make people feel loved and valuable in whatever God calls me to, I\u2019ll be stoked!**What role does trusting Jesus play in fulfilling that\u00a0calling?**A big one! Hahaha, I\u2019ve heard it said \u201cIf your dream seems achievable in the now, your dreaming too small.\u201d So dreaming beyond your natural requires you to trust something beyond yourself and for me I knew that 100% needed to be Jesus.**Is \u2018living on mission\u2019 an important part of your faith, and\u00a0why?**For me, living and sharing the message of hope and life in Jesus, is a mission worth taking up. Jesus first loved me, He has given me the gift of life in full and relationship with Him; how can I keep that gift to myself? We have been given permission and called by God to share this gift. It\u2019s too easy to stop once we have the benefit of it, but true love is compelled to share itself.**How do you daily live on\u00a0mission?**To me, it\u2019s not some weird role, or holy title or anything like that\u2026it\u2019s just living authentically as a Christian. You know just living life, but with intention and purpose, knowing I\u2019m part of something life-giving and just journeying with Jesus and others in that process. Not being afraid to be authentically me and to listen to and being able to respond to the life and love I feel God wants me to bring into each situation."

        "body": "_The recent news of the Christian Pastor committing suicide shocked the Christian world. A lot of times, as Christians, we don\u2019t wan\u2019t to admit when we\u2019re struggling mentally. However, it\u2019s important for us to realise that Christians go through bouts of depression and anxiety too. The good news is that God is with us and faithfulness will never leave us.__Here\u2019s a blog written by our friends at Cru (_[_https://www.cru.org_](https://www.cru.org/)_)_\u00a0_addressing Christians that are battling depression._I close my eyes, turn toward the back of the couch and curl my knees up to my chest.\u201cDon\u2019t hang up,\u201d I cry softly into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to be alone.\u201dMy husband\u2019s coming home early. Today\u2019s one of the bad days._If I admit my thoughts to someone, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy. Am I going crazy?__No. You\u2019re not._For me, depression came with the winter, though warning signs signaling its approach could be felt and seen much sooner. A born and bred Southern girl, I\u2019d gotten married, started a new job and moved across the country to Minnesota, all within two weeks and just in time for the cold.I was tired. Really tired. I was edgy and emotional and anxious. I began noticing that I felt exactly like it looked outside\u200a\u2014\u200agray and miserable. Numb. I sank further and further until finally breaking down one day at a work conference. I just couldn\u2019t go through the motions anymore when I felt like I was dying inside._If you\u2019re in the thick of the dark and lonely hell that is depression, I wish I could wrap my arms around you and cry with you, because I know how badly you hurt. Come take my virtual hand and know you\u2019re not alone._As a Christian, depression tempted me to distrust God. I was desperately seeking deliverance He seemed to withhold from me._Why won\u2019t you lift me out of this pit?_\u00a0I\u2019d cry.\u00a0_Aren\u2019t you a deliverer? Why do the voices of despair sound so much louder than yours?_I don\u2019t have the answers. But here are 3 things we can cling to as Christians walking through depression:# 1. We are not\u00a0aloneWhen I\u2019m depressed, I can\u2019t read about God\u2019s promises. It hurts too much. But within the pages of the Bible, I find friends.Check out these words from Jeremiah, Elijah and David:_\u201cO LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived\u201d_\u00a0Jeremiah 20:7  \u00a0_\u201cIt is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life\u201d_\u00a01 Kings 19:4  \u00a0_\u201cI say to God, my rock: \u2018Why have you forgotten me?\u2019\u201d_\u00a0Psalm 42:9\u201310The Bible gives many examples of people experiencing depression, darkness and even frustration with God. He isn\u2019t angered by honest words\u200a\u2014\u200aHe deems them holy. God wants our relationships with Him to be authentic. His mercy reigns even in our brokenness.The ultimate Friend we find in our pain is Jesus himself. He wept. And on the cross, He experienced separation from God in its fullness. Our Savior knows what it means to suffer.# 2. God\u2019s love and faithfulness are never dependent on\u00a0usDepression makes it hard to choose the \u201cright Christian things.\u201d I didn\u2019t usually trust God, make a gratitude list, or even recite prayers and Scripture. My shield of faith was often lying next to me on the ground.I wish I\u00a0_had_\u00a0done those things. But in my not doing them, God taught me the most valuable lesson of my life: His love for me is solely dependent on His character, grace and goodness.That\u2019s it.Because I\u2019ve placed my faith in Jesus and He\u2019s paid for all my sin and brokenness on the cross, He will never walk away from me. And more incredibly,\u00a0_He doesn\u2019t even want to._# 3. Pain doesn\u2019t have to be\u00a0wasted_He can handle our doubts, frustrations, failures and darkest moments because He is an astoundingly gracious God. He loves us through it all, because that is simply who He is._Tears roll down my cheeks when I hear someone say they want to kill themselves, because I\u2019ve been there. Empathy is powerful. It enables us to comfort others and know how to pray for them.As I was healing from a season of deep depression and anxiety, I got to sit next to a young woman who was in the thick of it. I listened. I offered my story. Tears streamed down her face as she whispered a thousand \u201cMe, toos.\u201d I put my arm around this woman and prayed for the things I myself had needed just a few months before.Ultimately, God will always use us to bring hope to others who are hurting, because we\u2019ve been where they are and made it to the other side. Hope means the most when it\u2019s come, stumbling, out of the dark places.If you\u2019re depressed, tell someone. Tell a doctor, friend, family member or counsellor. Please do not suffer alone._Originally written and published at\u00a0_[_www.cru.org_](https://www.cru.org/us/en/blog/life-and-relationships/emotions/to-the-depressed-christian.html)_._"

It\u2019s a sobering moment when you realise all the different things that you have given your attention to across a day. A negative thought, a fear, the past, a TV series that you just binged, your marriage\u2026 etc.> What we give attention to, we give authority to.If we choose to allow our attention to be on God, we allow Him to work in and through us. Our thought life changes, our priorities change and we see His power at work in our day to day life. The Bible says in\u00a0[Philippians 4:8;](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A8&version=NIV)\u201cSo keep your thoughts continually fixed on all that is authentic and real, honourable and admirable, beautiful and respectful, pure and holy, merciful and kind.

([2 Timothy 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+1%3A9&version=NIV))> Saved is our identity. Called is our purpose. Knowing our identity means we know who we are and whose we\u00a0are.To be \u2018saved\u2019 means to be saved from eternal separation from God (a life focused on self), and saved into eternal relationship with God (a life focused on God).

What an honor!**Knowing our identity is key to sharing our faith because our identity allows us to truly outwork our purpose. It is hard to help others understand who they are in Christ when we don\u2019t truly know ourselves.**How is your relationship with Jesus? Do you fully know who and whose you are?

        "title": "Is Christianity A Western Religion?",
        "body": "We have a tendency to link different religious beliefs with certain parts of the world. When we think of Islam, for example, we immediately think of the Middle-East. When we think about a religion like Taoism, we immediately think of Far-Eastern people groups like the Japanese.And when we think of Christianity, we generally think of the West\u2026 and rightly so. The Christian faith played a huge role in shaping Western civilisation.But does that make Christianity a Western religion?1. Christianity is Actually From the EastYou\u2019ve probably seen those pictures of Jesus with fair skin, blue eyes and long-wavy hair. Most actors that have played Jesus in the movies have been dashing white-skinned Europeans or Americans.But what if I told you that the real Jesus looked a lot less like that and a lot more like one of us.Jesus was actually from the Middle-East. He was born and spent most of his life in present-day Israel and Palestine. He had brown skin, dark eyes and his hair probably didn\u2019t look like something out of a shampoo commercial.He dressed more like us than people in the West. He spoke Aramaic, not American English. And he grew up in a culture much closer to ours than to the West.Christianity actually reached the shores of India a few centuries before it reached Europe. In fact, there were thriving Christian communities and established churches in Kerala more than two thousand years ago.> The truth is: Christianity is a lot more Eastern than it is Western.2. Christianity transcends CultureOver the years we\u2019ve been lead to believe that Christianity is \u201creligion\u201d. But in order to understand it properly, it\u2019s important that we look at it as relationship. It really doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, or who you are. We\u2019re all invited to have a personal and intimate relationship with Jesus.It\u2019s almost like a relationship with a really close friend. They\u2019re your friend in spite of the person you are, and accept you for who you are. The incredible thing about a relatioship with Jesus is that he doesn\u2019t expect you to change your culture, your last name, the way you speak, or even the way you dress, he accepts you as you are for who you are.Remember that we are created unique, in order to experience him in a way that is truly unique to us. Don\u2019t let cultural or regional barriers come in the way of you truly experiencing Jesus\u2019 unconditional love. \u270c\ud83c\udffc_\u201cBut, why do I need Jesus?\u201d you might be asking. Here\u2019s the thing, we all go through life seeking some sort of purpose, for some it might be happiness, or recognition, power, success, money. The thing about seeking these things, is that we\u2019re never really going to reach a point of satisfaction with them. We\u2019re always going to want more money, or more power or success. The constant longing for these things leads us on an endless, and sometimes frustrating journey of seeking this \u201cultimate purpose\u201d for our lives.__I can tell you without a doubt that Christ\u2019s love changes our wants and desires, and in turn redirects our purpose. It\u2019s actually pretty incredible._"

        "body": "The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the most beautiful story ever told. Whenever I think about the Gospel, I always go back to the song Amazing Grace:> Amazing grace / How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me / I once was lost / But now am found / Was blind but now I seeThere is a reason why we it\u2019s called\u00a0_amazing_\u00a0grace. There\u2019s a reason why we are called\u00a0wretched. It has a lot to do with parts of the Gospel that need to be addressed faithfully.> Sadly, a lot of Christians avoid talking about certain truths or words to make the Gospel look like a feel-good thing, making Christianity look like a cool club you would want to\u00a0join.This is why we\u2019ll be doing this series called\u00a0\u201cWords That Scare People\u201d, and I hope it will help you embrace difficult words associated with the Gospel and look at them as vital to the whole story of God\u2019s redemptive plan. Words like:\u00a0_HELL, REPENT, PERSECUTION,__\u00a0and\u00a0__RELIGION._Sadly, a lot of Christians steer clear of these words in conversations to avoid offending people. What they don\u2019t understand is that\u00a0_the Gospel is really offensive_\u00a0because it really makes you deal with your sin.> Christianity is not a social club, it is a life that knows how to count the cost. To follow Jesus is not easy, but it\u2019s definitely worth dying\u00a0for.Our prayer is that as you read through the succeeding articles, you will have an open mind. Wrestle with the truth, seek His heart in all of this, and may your faith be strengthened and renewed.#### The Full\u00a0GospelThat being said, how do we know that the gospel we share isn\u2019t watered down yet not unnecessarily offensive? Here are a few things we should tell people when we share our faith so that they can understand the gospel as a whole.##### 1. God is\u00a0HOLYIsaiah 6:3 tells us about the holiness of God. \u201cHoliness\u201d has two simple meanings: to be\u00a0_morally perfect_\u00a0and to be\u00a0_set apart_. When holiness is used to describe God it means both these things. It kind of says something like this \u201cGod is so morally good and perfect and pure that there is no one else like Him. There is no other being, person, place, or thing like God.\u201d##### 2. We are\u00a0SINFUL> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, (Romans 3:23)We don\u2019t often like to admit that we\u2019re imperfect of have done anything wrong. However, the Bible is very clear in our standing before a holy God. If we use our own standards for morality and goodness, many of us would probably make it to heaven, but when we consider that God\u2019s standard for goodness is Himself, we can easily admit that we have fallen short of His glory.##### 3. Jesus is our\u00a0MEDIATOR> Jesus answered, \u201cI am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d(John 14:6)Since sin separates us from God, we need someone to stand between God and man in order to be made right with Him. We need a mediator, someone who is holy so that He can stand in God\u2019s presence and yet someone who is human so that He can represent us. There is only one who fulfills these requirements:\u00a0Jesus Christ.##### 4. Jesus DIED and RESURRECTED to save\u00a0us> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)God gave His perfect Son to pay for the sins of imperfect people. The righteous for the unrighteous, the just for the unjust. Jesus also paid the price for all our sins by dying in our place (because that is the penalty for our sin). When someone believes in Christ alone for forgiveness and reconciliation to God, all their sins are forever forgiven and are declared righteous by God.##### 5. We need to decide to LIVE FOR\u00a0GOD> I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)No matter what race, gender, background, status, or upbringing, Jesus is willing and able to save any who will put their trust in Him.\u00a0Jesus saves you as you are, but He doesn\u2019t keep you there.\u00a0A relationship with Jesus is transformational. Coming to faith in Christ means that you no longer live for yourself, but for Him who saved you. Faith in Jesus also brings true freedom\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re no longer a slave to your past or your old habits\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re a new creation! And the follower of Jesus uses that freedom to live a life of faith in obedience to Him.> \u201cWhat now?\u201d you ask. This Good News isn\u2019t meant to stay in our heads but it\u2019s meant to play out in our lives as we live for Jesus and share about His saving grace to all. Go ahead and share THE\u00a0GOSPEL!"

        "title": "P\u00d8RTRAITS // Liv",
        "body": "Social Worker, Liv, chats with us about what it means to her to follow Jesus, to live fearless and how she is a visible portrait of Jesus to his world\u2026> Portraits Series inspiration:\u00a0> Jesus is the most revolutionary person to have ever lived, and if people can see Jesus for who He truly is, their lives will be radically changed.\u00a0[Colossians 1:15](http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm)> , says that Jesus is the visible portrait of the invisible God.\u00a0> Today, in the absence of the person of Jesus on Earth, we as Christians play a vital role in living on mission (through the Holy Spirit) and pointing people to Jesus by being visible portraits of Jesus to our world.# \u2014FAITH \u2014##How long have you been a Christian?I have known about Jesus for a long time and I have followed Him on and off over my life, but it was on the 26th March 2010, that I began my journey of truly surrendering my life to Jesus.##Why did you choose\u00a0Jesus?It\u2019s bizarre, I always knew that I would choose Jesus. It wasn\u2019t really a matter of if, but more so a question of when. For me, I thought loving Jesus equaled a whole lot of rules and restrictions, and that is not what I wanted for my life. I have always been a rule bender and my natural instinct when someone tells me what to do is to question it, do the opposite, push the boundaries and find my own way (right or wrong). So you can see how following the Jesus that I thought I knew, wouldn\u2019t have worked out so well. Over a few years, I realised that living life my own way continually led me to dark places filled with perpetual emptiness. It was in that dark empty place that I encountered a gracious, forgiving, loving and patient God, who was there all along, just waiting for me to say yes.##Who inspired you to choose\u00a0Jesus?Its more so a \u2018what\u2019, rather than \u2018who\u2019 for me. My insatiable need for more kept leading me down paths of hopelessness that always ended in heartache and emptiness. It was my own brokenness and my souls longing for more that led me to Jesus and His never-ending grace.##What has changed since choosing\u00a0Jesus?Oh goodness, everything! Practically and emotionally a lot changed, albeit slowly. I don\u2019t have one of those stories where I said yes to Jesus and overnight my thoughts, behaviours, attitudes, and desires miraculously changed. Rather, as I began to fall more in love with Jesus and discover my worth in Him, I began to let go (reluctantly at times) of a lot of things that ruled my life and bit by bit my identity (in Him) began to be rebuilt. It\u2019s amazing how a secure identity, in a steadfast God, can change the course of your life. I used to spend my life trying to find my identity in things and people, constantly trying to prove myself, protect myself, find worth and be good enough (I always fell short). This made me a very inwardly focused person; my life was all about me and who I was/wasn\u2019t, should/shouldn\u2019t be. I didn\u2019t like myself, yet was consumed by myself. Now I try to live my life generously giving for the sake of others, in whatever capacity that looks like (time, prayer, support, love). People matter and I desperately want people to know their worth, which can only be truly found in Jesus. I won\u2019t pretend that I have my life all figured out and that I feel 100% secure, loved and worthy all of the time, because I honestly don\u2019t. The difference is that I now have HOPE in a patient, gracious God that loves me anyway and continues to restore my brokenness back to fullness.##Why are you a part of a local\u00a0church?First and foremost, for me, church is about others, so being a part of my local church is all about serving, investing, loving and creating an inclusive and welcoming environment that helps people encounter Jesus. My mission is to do all I can to make sure that every new, lonely or regular person that walks through those doors knows that they are loved and that they matter. I don\u2019t want anyone to fall through the cracks, so I make it my responsibility to ensure they don\u2019t. Also, my local church is an oasis for me, a place of peace, growth, and joy, where I am surrounded by people that love, challenge and encourage me in my faith.# \u2014FEAR \u2014##Is fear a liar?\u00a0Why?Oww that\u2019s a hard one. Fear can certainly be a liar, but it can also be a protector. Fear can alert us to real life danger and be a catalyst that leads to a change in direction, to growth and even to survival. I guess the type of fear that is a liar is the fear that has been created in our own minds; the type of fear that leaves us paralysed, insecure, stuck, sick, broken. This type of fear needs to be faced.##What does it look like to live fearless to\u00a0you?For me, living a fearless life does not mean the absence of fear, it means living, even in the face of fear. I am in a season in my life where I could easily be weighed down by my own fears, because, to be honest, they are there and they are real. But instead, I am learning to declare God\u2019s peace in the midst of my fear. Sometimes people work so hard at not feeling things, like fear, that they actually become consumed with avoiding them, rather than overcoming them. So for me, right now, being fearless means naming my fears and not being afraid to face them. I love this Stephen King quote: \u201cif fear cannot be articulated, it cannot be conquered.\u201d##Who inspires you to live fearless?Ultimately Jesus. If you look at His life (actions, character, death), it is clear that although He was faced with situations that could paralyse anyone with fear, His trust in God remained steadfast and helped Him to live in spite of fear. Other than Jesus\u2026 Brene Brown, hands down. Her writing and studies inspire me to live a life characterised by vulnerability, authenticity and courage. It\u2019s a work in progress, but I am trying!##The voice of God and the voice of fear are both very real. What does it look like to you to live by the voice of\u00a0God?To live by the voice of God for me means to trust God. Sometimes I can\u2019t quite hear or distinguish the voice of God in different areas of my life, but I can always trust God in every area of my life. So whilst I wait to hear from God I remain soft-hearted, open-minded and trust wholeheartedly in His timing.##How does your faith push you out of your comfort\u00a0zone?My faith reminds me that people matter. So if I want to live with my faith in action then I need to show people that they matter. I need to love, pray, help, listen to, share with, care for and focus on other people. Loving and caring for ALL people can be messy and uncomfortable, but when I truly put my faith into action, my faith will not remain confined by my comfort zone, it will always push beyond that.##How would you encourage others to live fearless?I would encourage you to start by working out what your fears are and then begin working to overcome them. Ask God and others to help you, you don\u2019t need to go it alone! I know and believe that it is possible for you to live a life not bowing to fear, but a life abounding in freedom.# \u2014PURPOSE \u2014##What do you feel like your specific calling\u00a0is?I am still working this one out. I know that God has given me a heart devoted to Him, a mind wired for justice and a voice ready to advocate. Whatever my calling is, I want to make sure that I always strive to be others-focussed and justice driven. People need us to love, advocate, petition, pray and remember them. I don\u2019t want to remain stagnant whilst figuring out my calling. I\u2019d rather be proactive in chasing it down, learning and giving things a go.##What role does trusting Jesus play in fulfilling that\u00a0calling?Everything! Trust comes from knowing Jesus. And the Jesus that I know has only ever shown Himself to be good, so I will trust that He knows what is best for my life and that He will equip me along the way. If I didn\u2019t trust and hope in Jesus, I dare say that I would have bottomed out already! Loving others and seeking after justice is not a feat that I am capable of doing in my own strength. If I didn\u2019t have trust in Jesus, I would be constantly overwhelmed and would likely choose to do something easier, something less messy.##Is \u2018living on mission\u2019 an important part of your faith, and\u00a0why?Yes, of course. Living on mission is a part of being a Christian, it is who I am, not just an aspect of myself that I have assigned to a Sunday or to the four walls of a church building. Living on mission means putting my faith into action, any day and anywhere.##How do you daily live on\u00a0mission?For me, daily \u2018living on mission\u2019 means inviting God to guide me each day; being others focussed with my attention and time; being authentically myself and; being intentional in my interactions with people. People need to see Jesus in the way I live, not just in the words I say. Lately I have been asking God how I can truly start becoming the person that He created me to be and He showed me\u00a0[Psalms 15:2\u20135 (TPT)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+15%3A2-5&version=TPT)\u200a\u2014\u200aread it and like me, let it shape your character and guide how you live."

        "title": "How Do I Help Someone That Doesn\u2019t Think God Is There for Them?",
        "body": "It\u2019s surprising to see how many people have \u2018written God off\u2019 because they don\u2019t think God has been there for them. How can you help people to see the truth?There\u2019s never a formula, but there are some very practical ways you can go about helping people to see that God loves them and that He cares. This practical example involves you, you being Christlike to them to connect them to Jesus!Heres are 3 practical ways you can help## 1. Talk to\u00a0themTake time to talk to them and ask questions about why they feel this way. You\u2019re not looking for a quick fix solution here, and it\u2019s not a time for you to give suggestions. This is simply you drawing out information from them so you can understand where they are coming from. Giving time for someone to talk can do wonders, it may even help them to discover for themselves what it is that is causing these feelings. It might be hard for them to give you reasons why they feel the way that they do, so that\u2019s where open ended questions can help them along the way\u200a\u2014\u200athat means crafting a question where they need to give an answer more than a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. eg. \u201cHow long have you felt this way?\u201d instead of \u201cHave you felt like this for a long time?\u201d.  This shows that you care and want to spend time with them.## 2.\u00a0Listen to\u00a0themI know this doesn\u2019t sound like rocket science, but listening means you are not the one talking. It can be harder than you think sometimes. The art of listening means taking time to consider and listen to what the person has to say, without butting in with suggestions or solutions. There is so much you can gain from this; the person feels valued, it also helps them to express the problems, and lastly it gives you invaluable insight.  This shows that you want to be involved in their life.## 3. Connect\u00a0themThis is now the time where you can begin to help them to \u2018connect the dots\u2019 or be the bridge where \u2018the gaps\u2019 exist. Connection will happen in a variety of ways, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s so important you are getting guidance from the Holy Spirit\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the Holy Spirit\u2019s timing and not yours. It will only be in the context of conversation and spending time with the person that you will be able to start getting an idea of why a barrier exists. Keep things simple and take care not bombard them with thoughts or to \u2018have all the answers\u2019, you don\u2019t, but God does! You can offer a solution, a relationship with God. Jesus never forced himself on anyone, He spoke truth in love and gave people a choice for relationship.  This shows you want real relationship with themWhen Jesus healed the man at the pool in\u00a0[John 5:5\u20139](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A5-9&version=ESV), we see a clear example of this; Jesus talked, then he listened, then he connected. People usually end up being distanced from God over a period of time and circumstances. Whether the problem started because they have never considered God to exist, or they\u2019ve felt distanced from God because of misunderstanding or major trauma, the way to help point them to Jesus is to give them a living example of what Jesus would do.[Ecclesiastes 3:1\u20138](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A1%E2%80%938&version=ESV)\u00a0reminds us that there are many seasons of life. Some last longer than others. If this has not been a short term problem, it\u2019s often that the solution will not be short term either. Now, that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t trust God for his miracle working power in the person\u2019s life. Pray for that and expect it.Taking time to build community around the person is important. Be careful not to abandon them! It\u2019s important that they are well connected into a community of people with ongoing support, love, care and family.**Be encouraged, you are that Christlike example! Be bold, expect miracles, and move in faith.**"

Let me summarize\u2026 The Israelites are under siege from their invading arch-enemies, the Philistines. Frustrated that their king is doing nothing about the situation, Jonathon and his Armor Bearer (let\u2019s call them Jonny and Ronny) decide to go up to the Philistine camp and pick a fight. They instigate a small skirmish with a group of Philistines, which escalates into a full-scale battle where the Philistines freak out and start killing each other.Jonny and Ronny had no idea how the story would end. In fact, the premise for this whole venture was a \u201cmaybe\u201d! _Jonathan said to his armor bearer,_ \u201cCome on now, let\u2019s go across to these uncircumcised pagans. **Maybe **God will work for us.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a[**1 Samuel 14:6**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+14%3A6&version=NIV)Two guys.

But even if we say so, our lives do not reflect this preference or position. It seems we do not truly understand nor have fully surrendered to the truths of our salvation.\u00a0> We continue with our worldly ways and we fear not the reality of hell. As Christians, we need to reorient ourselves and revitalize our expressions of a full\u00a0Gospel.Hell is perhaps one of the scariest themes in the Bible. It is even observable that some churches do not preach and teach on this. In fact, we learn of _\u201cGod loves you and He has the best plan for your life!\u201d_ but not of\u200a\u2014\u200a**_eternal separation from God_**\u200a\u2014\u200afor those who will not put their faith in Jesus Christ. To avoid scaring, offending, or alienating others, self-help topics are more of the focus.##### Why do we need to talk about hell? Because it is as real as\u00a0heaven.When we read the Bible\u200a\u2014\u200athere is a significant amount of references about hell\u200a\u2014\u200asuffering, eternal fire, eternal destruction, and never-ending torment. Hell exists because we all have sinned against God. Since we have an infinite and eternal God, our punishment is also infinite and eternal. Naturally, this is hard for a lot of people to wrap their heads around. _But if you study the Gospels carefully, Jesus spoke more about hell than heaven._ So why are a lot of Christians avoiding this topic?**_1._****_To avoid offending others._**Many avoid \u201chell\u201d when sharing the Gospel to loved ones or strangers. The thinking is\u200a\u2014\u200aavoid offense, keep relationships\u200a\u2014\u200asounds good. _But not so at the cost of truth. _Newsflash: The Gospel is truly offensive! Jesus Himself talked straight during the Sermon on the Mount, and we all know what happened there\u200a\u2014\u200asome people walked away and stopped following Jesus, while others remained and continued to be His followers.**_2._****_Having a wrong view of God\u2019s love_**_. _Many ask:_ \u201cHow can a loving God send people to hell?\u201d_ This is focusing on God\u2019s love which is a good thing. But are we asking the right question? Because of this, _God\u2019s justice, righteousness, and holiness are neglected._ God\u2019s characteristics work harmoniously for the glory of His Name, which was perfectly shown through Jesus Christ\u2019s death on the Cross.**God is perfect and His ways are just** (Deuteronomy 32:4).\u00a0> If we truly understand the God we worship, hell should not be an issue for us. Rather, we should be encouraged to share the Gospel without holding back on explaining the reality of\u00a0hell.##### If we confess, repent, ask forgiveness, and believe in Jesus, we will gain salvation, redemption, forgiveness and the promise of eternal life. If we reject His free gift of eternal life, then we will face eternal separation from God and will be punished\u00a0forever.You should not fear talking about hell to someone who needs God\u2019s saving grace. _Embrace the reality, put it into God\u2019s perspective, and let the Holy Spirit guide your proclamation & demonstration!_"

The result: a diluted message or worse, a deceitful one.\u00a0> Whether as omissions by choice or careless oversights, shall we give thought to the consequences? Shall we think through why it scares us so much to use certain\u00a0words?One word that we \u201clike\u201d to avoid is REPENT.In the Bible, REPENT means, \u201c_to change one\u2019s mind_.\u201d This definition reminds of Romans 12:2 which says,_\u201c_**_2 _**_Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God\u2019s will is\u200a\u2014\u200ahis good, pleasing and perfect will.\u201d_> To renew your mind requires total change. A 180 degree turn. The Bible also tells us that when someone truly repents this will result in a change of\u00a0actions.\u00a0Just look at what Acts 3:19 says:**_\u201c19 _**_Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,\u201d_##### A change of mind results to a change of\u00a0actions.\u00a0Yet there is often an incongruence between our **declarations** (speech) and **demonstrations** (actions) as Christians. We say one thing and do another.\u00a0We quote from the Bible or our favorite preacher, then post a less than prudent photo or join a hate discussion. _How then are we representing Jesus, the Lord and Savior of the Gospel?_\u00a0> Jesus is not someone we can conveniently add to or hide from our lives. Hence, there should be no duality in the Christian life. If Jesus to us is optional, that means we have not yet had a change of mind, meaning there\u2019s also no evidence of a change of\u00a0action.So what does it mean to REPENT\u200a\u2014\u200ato be truly repentant of our lives before Jesus? We become aware of our sinful nature, rebellious posture and selfish gestures that are not pleasing to God. And we ask Him to help us overcome ourselves. We begin to understand that God\u2019s attributes and our identity in Him. And we experience the grace that He so freely gives.##### For us to receive salvation, repentance\u200a\u2014\u200aproperly understood\u200a\u2014\u200ais necessary.\u00a0A truly repentant person will have observable changes and godly convictions. He or she is called to be salt and light in this world. Therefore other people should experience Jesus in and through us as Christ followers. Why would people consider Christianity if we keep sharing about Jesus yet show that we are still our worldly selves? _A truly repentant life can be used by God to draw more people to the Gospel._In all, before identifying ourselves as Christians and inviting others to Christianity, let us assess our personal salvation and transformation. If you truly understand how important repentance is, you would truly want to tell people about it. Be encouraged and don\u2019t be afraid because to repent is to experience God\u2019s forgiveness that truly saves!"

After all, it does not sound or look appealing by human standards.\u201cWhen you become a Christian, your life will be prosperous!\u201d is naturally more attractive than \u201cWhen you become a Christian, you will be persecuted!\u201dWith that our evangelistic and discipleship messages appear as such:> Best life ever!> Health, wealth, and prosperity!> God ALWAYS blesses us with what we ask for as long as we pray and to Him!> The Christian life is always going to be great!Present these and expect a great flood of people, perhaps more than can be imagined\u200a\u2014\u200aor managed, into our churches. Many will come through our doors. But really, how many will truly know and live the true Gospel?For that let us take a pause and process what the Bible says:_\u201cIndeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\u201d__2 Timothy 3:12_The Apostle Paul, once a persecutor of the Early Church, explains the cost of following Jesus Christ. He teaches that a godly life is not alluring to the world. In fact, it is repulsive\u2026But before we go any further, let us clarify that:_We acknowledge the truth that God blesses His children. More obvious (than often), it will be in material\u200a\u2014\u200aphysical or financial form.__And we are also aware of the reality that God chooses to bless His children according to His sovereignty. Some will have wealth and health, while others will have less of these. Some will be gifted and called in areas that others are not._##### BUT these are NOT what the Gospel is\u00a0about.\u00a0The true message is that we are sinners in need of salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ. He willingly lived as man and suffered a most painful death death on the cross, as payment for the penalty of our sins.Some of us may think that we live in different times such that persecution is no longer relevant to the greater majority of Christians. But truth is, more Christians are actually being killed for their faith in Jesus.And to further understand why a life devoted to following Jesus Christ will be persecuted\u200a\u2014\u200areviled or spoken against\u200a\u2014\u200ahere are some points from John Piper\u2019s article _\u201cBlessed are the Persecuted\u201d_:*  _If you cherish chastity, your life will be an attack on people\u2019s love for free sex._* _If you embrace temperance, your life will be a statement against the love of alcohol._* _If you pursue self-control, your life will indict excess eating._* _If you live simply and happily, you will show the folly of luxury._* _If you walk humbly with your God, you will expose the evil of pride._* _If you are punctual and thorough in your dealings, you will lay open the inferiority of laziness and negligence._* _If you speak with compassion, you will throw callousness into sharp relief._* _If you are earnest, you will make the flippant look flippant instead of clever._* _if you are spiritually minded, you will expose the worldly-mindedness of those around you.\u201d__For the complete article you can go to this link: _[_https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/blessed-are-the-persecuted_](https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/blessed-are-the-persecuted)> My simple advice and plea: DO NOT avoid talking about persecution when sharing the Gospel or the Christian journey. It is our calling and honor to proclaim (and demonstrate) the\u00a0truth.I am not writing this article to tell you that you should enjoy or seek persecution for your faith.

As you build relationship and become aware that God is at work in your life as a real and loving Father, the roar of fear gradually becomes a pathetic squeak.The key is recognising and celebrating the small wins, and throw them back in the face of fear. A small win may have involved sharing your experience of Jesus, or maybe it was just an opportunity to serve someone. What matters is that you see the win for what it is, allowing you to see God at work in the people around you."

All I can seem to think of is my ride back home, how fast I\u2019m going to tackle that hill climb, who\u2019s time record I\u2019ll beat, etc. Ever since I started cycling to work, I\u2019ve viewed it as an excuse to introspect, be alone, and away detach myself from all distractions. However, at the end of every ride, I feel the need to snap a picture and share it on social media, as if to invite people to celebrate my loneliness with me.Ironic, isn\u2019t it? The very activity I indulge in to detach myself, ends up becoming a plea for approval and affirmation. What\u2019s sad is that the people that end up liking my post are people I would never really interact with outside of my mobile phone screen, and yet I still crave their approval.Somewhere along the way, I got it all wrong. Life became less about loving people and sharing memories with them and more about me, and how I was catering to my needs.However, I didn\u2019t lose the desire to have real and meaningful connections with people, I just forgot how to go about having them. I expected people to somehow perceive that I was lonely, and then reach out to me. I thought to myself, \u201cI mean come on, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s lonely, people should be reaching out to me\u201d. And\u2026\u2026Therein lay the fundamental cause of my loneliness\u200a\u2014\u200aI wasn\u2019t reaching out to people.We as a society are constantly bombarded with messages that promote individuality. So much of advertising now days focuses on \u201cme and my needs and desires\u201d and rarely ever presents us with a message that tells us that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around us. Combine this with social media and the nature of social media interaction, and you have a society of people who care more about online interactions (likes, follows, comments, etc) than physical ones.What can we(you) do about it?1. Reach outGet off your phone, go out and interract with people. I know its not as easy as it sounds, but it isn\u2019t supposed to be. It\u2019s supposed to take time. All relationships of value have lots and lots of time backing them up.> \u201cLoneliness isn\u2019t the physical absence of other people\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s the sense that you\u2019re not sharing anything that matters with anyone else. If you have lots of people around you\u200a\u2014\u200aperhaps even a husband or wife, or a family, or a busy workplace\u200a\u2014\u200abut you don\u2019t share anything that matters with them, then you\u2019ll still be lonely.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJohann\u00a0HariMake memories and share experiences with people because chances are those are what you\u2019ll remember ten years down the relationship.2.\u00a0Find people like youThere are numerous communities that cater to people with similar interests. Find one, and ease your way into being a part of it. These \u201cinterests\u201d can be a hobby, a sport, or even a church community.> Be intentional about finding a community that will care for you and nurture\u00a0you.3.\u00a0Be PositiveIt\u2019s so easy for us to get weighed down by one unsuccessful and awkward interaction with someone(or a group of people). However, believe the best about people and always be willing to give people a chance.Hang in there, because your life isn\u2019t going to change over night\u200a\u2014\u200aand it shouldn\u2019t. Friendships that last a lifetime, are ones that have the work put into them."

You know, your crew of close friends, where you can go from an outrageous joke to a really deep and sensitive topic in under a minute, then whip out another joke and get right back to the fun.Jesus had an inner circle. He was the most inclusive person, always friendly to strangers and happy to address the thousands, yet he also had a smaller group of 12 people (His disciples), and then another smaller group of 3, that he spent most of His time with.If you\u2019ve managed to build these kinds of friendships with other Christians, you are aware that the \u2018God factor\u2019 adds another depth to the great friendships.

        "body": "Young Software Developer, Willem, chats with us about what it means to him to follow Jesus, to live fearless and how he is a visible portrait of Jesus to his world\u2026#### \u2014 FAITH\u00a0\u2014##### How long have you been a Christian?6 years. I made the decision to follow Jesus while I was at a youth camp when I was 14.##### Why did you choose\u00a0Jesus?I\u2019ve always been interested in science and maths and looking around at the world around me I saw so much evidence of God. The fact that Jesus (God\u2019s Son) would die to bring me into a relationship with Him blew my mind. I used to see God as a distant impersonal being, but once I realised that an all-powerful God wanted to be my personal friend and advocate\u2026 it was hard to pass up on an opportunity like that.##### Who inspired you to choose\u00a0Jesus?My parents and grandparents. They\u2019ve got such real relationships with Him which means a lot to each of them. Hearing stories of how God has worked in their lives inspired me to choose Jesus and constantly inspires me to live for Him.##### What has changed since choosing\u00a0Jesus?I have a hope and peace that I didn\u2019t have before. This has freed me up to love people better because I\u2019m not worrying about the details of my life as much; I can just pass it onto him and trust that he\u2019s got everything under control. Another side of that coin is that he\u2019s helped me to see the inherent value he places in everyone, making it easier to love them.##### Why are you a part of a local\u00a0church?I believe God created us to do life together and I find the local church community a great place to do that. We help each other understand God in ways that we don\u2019t see on our own. We hear perspectives that open our world. It\u2019s also space where we work together as a team for the good of the community around us, both outside the church and inside. Jesus said that the church is His body; it takes a body to enact tangible change and I want to be part of the work that Jesus is doing in the world.#### \u2014 FEAR\u00a0\u2014##### Is fear a liar?\u00a0Why?The fear that stops me from being who I know I should be is a liar. Fear keeps you trapped but with Jesus you are free.##### What does it look like to live fearless to\u00a0you?Trust. Trusting that God wants to identify himself with me. Believing that He would trust me to be part of His story. Knowing that He\u2019s prepared me for the things that He\u2019s got planned. For example, when I moved interstate away from family and friends to start working full-time as a software developer, I was in a place where I had opportunities in multiple directions and I felt at peace about choosing any of them. Trusting Him meant I didn\u2019t have the weight of asking \u201cwhat if?\u201d; wherever I was, He could use me for his purpose.##### Who inspires you to live fearless?My friends. They constantly remind me that God is bigger than anything we could come up against. They encourage and push me further into discovering more about God and who He is. They take risks for others and live to see God move in the world around them. They don\u2019t have everything figured out but they seek to take Jesus at His word and act on it.##### The voice of God and the voice of fear are both very real. What does it look like to you to live by the voice of\u00a0God?The fear when it comes often expresses itself as doubt. Learning to doubt my doubts and trust that God\u2019s got everything under control means those fears don\u2019t hold me back as much when God prompts me to do something. They\u2019re still there but God is bigger. I don\u2019t always follow through but when I do I find my faith in him grows. It\u2019s a journey.##### How does your faith push you out of your comfort\u00a0zone?Opening up and sharing doesn\u2019t come naturally for me so writing this is pushing me. Leading children\u2019s camps pushes me too (just staying functional after 4 nights of 5 hours of sleep). Faith helps me realise that I\u2019m not the centre of the universe. There\u2019s so much about God that I don\u2019t know. As a developer I need to know how a system works so that I can improve it and make it work to solve the problem it\u2019s aiming to solve. With this mindset I naturally love figuring out how systems work. It\u2019s not so easy with God but I love how humbling it is.##### How would you encourage others to live fearless?Believe that God\u2019s bigger than your circumstances and take opportunities to live it practically. I find trust comes from experience so I want to live life with God rather than just know the theory about Him. The small steps you take to add action to your belief give space for Jesus to show you just how much you mean to him. As He shows you more of Himself you naturally begin to trust Him more. It becomes a cycle.#### \u2014 PURPOSE\u00a0\u2014##### What do you feel like your specific calling\u00a0is?Haha! That\u2019s something I\u2019m still figuring out! Right now I spend most of my time building software to help people develop authentic relationships with God and with others. I also love leading camps for children; seeing their joy when they conquer their fears climbing the rock wall or when jumping from the zip line is so rewarding. Being able to share with them the relationship I have with Jesus and watch as they come to a fuller understanding of who He is makes my day.##### What role does trusting Jesus play in fulfilling that\u00a0calling?A huge one! Especially when leading children. They learn so much and take in everything we do as adults. I\u2019m aware of the example I\u2019m being yet I know I\u2019m going to get it wrong. I have to trust that Jesus will use me to show the kids that it\u2019s alright to not have everything together because that\u2019s His place in their life.##### Is \u2018living on mission\u2019 an important part of your faith, and\u00a0why?Yeah, it is. I want others to experience a similar relationship with Jesus and see him transform their lives too.##### How do you daily live on\u00a0mission?I lead a\u00a0_small group\u00a0_(connect group/Bible study) and encourage my friends there to seek God and get closer to Him. I believe that as we get closer we desire to see others get closer too. I love inviting people to a\u00a0_small group\u00a0_because it\u2019s a place where we really get to know God together."

        "body": "The Bible has some rad stories. A favourite is the story of Jonathon and his Armour Bearer in\u00a0[1 Samuel 13\u201314](https://www.bible.com/bible/97/1SA.13.msg). Let me summarise\u2026 The Israelites are under siege from their invading arch-enemies, the Philistines. Frustrated that their king is doing nothing about the situation, Jonathon and his Armour Bearer (let\u2019s call them Jonny and Ronny) decide to go up to the Philistine camp and pick a fight. They instigate a small skirmish with a group of Philistines, which escalates into a full-scale battle when the Philistines freak out and start killing each other.Jonny and Ronny had no idea how the story would end. In fact, the premise for this whole venture was a \u201cmaybe\u201d!\u00a0_Jonathan said to his armour bearer,_\u201cCome on now, let\u2019s go across to these uncircumcised pagans\u00a0_(LOL)_.\u00a0MaybeGod will work for us.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a[1 Samuel 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+14%3A6&version=NIV)\u00a0Two guys. Up against literally hundreds of thousands of Philistines. Having a go, based on a whim. Talk about guts!> Jonny and Ronny based their choices, not on fear of their circumstance, but on convictions of who their God\u00a0was.What an encouragement to share Jesus despite our fears. We serve a God whose desire is that \u201c_none should perish but that all would come to repentance._\u201d ([2 Peter 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A9&version=NIV)) That\u2019s more than a maybe!.I encourage you!

And I think this is the hope we should hold on too.Apostle John says in John 7:5,_\u201cFor even His brothers did not believe in Him.\u201d_It\u2019s amazing to think that someone who lived with Jesus for over thirty years, did not know him. So don\u2019t be discouraged by the fact that you stand alone in your faith in God.Here are some tips that can help you on your journey to salvation.##Love UnconditionallyLuke 10:27 says,\u201cSo he answered and said, \u201c \u2018You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,\u2019[a] and \u2018your neighbor as yourself.\u201dNo matter where your family is in their faith, love them with all you have.

He demands that you simply\u00a0> love everybody!##Actions Speak LouderIf you go on pestering them about Christ, it won\u2019t happen. You can preach, scream, yell, speak\u200a\u2014\u200abut this just makes them shut you out completely.If you want to make a real difference, be more Christ-like in everything you do!Love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Exercise each of these gifts every day, and their hearts will turn to God, in His time!##Changing Hearts Is His JobIt\u2019s one of the most important things to realize and change within us. Even as you spread the good news with people around you, keep in mind that His spirit dwells in you, and because of that you are saved.It doesn\u2019t matter where you are, who your family is, or what situation you are in, He has already won your heart, and the victory is His.Many people try to play God. They get angry and frustrated that the people they love aren\u2019t accepting Christ. But here\u2019s a reminder from the Bible that He is above everything.1 Corinthians 3:7 says,\u201cSo then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.\u201dSo instead of the futile attempt we make, let\u2019s pray and have the patience to let God work in their lives.##Hardship Will ComeThe Christian walk is not an easy one. There will be people who judge, criticize and hate you for choosing this life. But remember what Jesus said in Matthew 5:11\u201312,\u201cBlessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\u201dSo don\u2019t be discouraged when people hurt or out you down for your faith. The best things to do is walk away from the situation and thank God that He has you safely tucked under His protection!Don\u2019t ever give up on the work He has called you to do, which is to spread the good news to each and every corner of the earth!"

A list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts?Commonly used in evangelical communities, the phrase \u201c**_Christianity is not a religion; it\u2019s a relationship_,**\u201d has become standard and familiar. It is a statement that has become popular in preachings or Gospel presentations.Personally, I grew up hearing this and have thus become part of how I share my faith to others. My understanding is it helps\u200a\u2014\u200aboth the sharer and listener\u200a\u2014\u200afocus on the relationship aspect with Jesus Christ versus the organized religious aspect which most people associate with \u201c**_Christianity_**\u201d.However, since we have not really studied the truth about religion, we avoid discussing the matter in depth. Allow me to challenge us with this thought:\u00a0> Are we dispensing truth when we say \u201cChristianity is not a religion; it\u2019s a relationship\u201d?In Webster\u2019s dictionary, religion is defined as:**_(1): _**_the service and worship of God or the supernatural_**_(2): _**_commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance_##### Isn\u2019t that a definition of what it means to be a follower of\u00a0Jesus?Another compelling definition of religion is found in James 1:26\u201327:**_26 _**_If anyone thinks he is religious without controlling his tongue, then his religion is useless and he deceives himself. _**_27 _**_Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world._James did not define religion as an institution or ceremonial rituals; he described it as a lifestyle of service and a lifestyle of dying to self. That definition in itself is what it means to follow Jesus._We should redefine religion as a lifestyle because the Bible explains it that way. _When religion becomes more focused on man-made laws, it becomes the very thing that Jesus hated. It becomes the very thing that Jesus stood up against. No local church is exempted from trying to look good externally but really empty internally when it comes to grace, compassion, love and mercy.As I write this, I myself am being challenged because I have used that popular phrase a lot of times. I am not here to tell you I am right, but I am here to challenge your personal beliefs. And I hope this article helps you in your spiritual growth.##### I have so much to learn still, but I would like to end with these thoughts:1. True religion is not about earning God\u2019s approval, but rather responding to God\u2019s saving grace through faith in Jesus Christ.2. True religion is based on a genuine and intimate relationship Jesus Christ.> I do not think \u201creligion\u201d and \u201crelationship\u201d are in contradiction\u200a\u2014\u200aIF we truly understand their proper definitions and Biblical concepts.My only plea is that we study God\u2019s Word before we agree on popular statements. Understand that we as the church are responsible in faithfully proclaiming the Word of God."

Whether it gives them courage or makes them want to give up, is all in what you say.> This is why my all-time favourite Bible verse about speaking comes from Ephesians 4:29 -\u201cLet no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers.\u201dNow that we know that our tongue is such a powerful tool, let\u2019s ask some questions \ud83e\udd14_1.

She explained that even though she\u2019d recently started \u201cbelieving in Jesus\u201d, she felt that she was headed for hell because of a decision to become intimate with her boyfriend outside of marriage. She was terrified, and was asking me for advice on what she should do.I\u2019m not going to lie, writing my response was difficult. There was so much fear in her words and I was confused as to whether her new adoption of Christianity as a religion was missing the key part; a trust\u00a0_in_\u00a0and relationship\u00a0_with_\u00a0Jesus.> \u201cI want to give my life to Christ and do everything right but [giving up that intimacy] is the one thing I\u2019m too afraid to do because it would mean losing someone I\u2019ve been in love with for 3 years. But when I read the bible it says you can\u2019t do it and I know you have to keep the commandments if you want to go to heaven. I\u2019m absolutely terrified of going to hell to the point where it is ruining my life.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSasha**My heart broke.**Sasha was desperate for the gift of salvation that Jesus offers, but confused about what accepting that gift would mean for her this side of eternity.It also sounded like she was being deceived by the lie that she could only access salvation if she obeyed \u201cthe law\u201d in her own strength first.Because I had once shared Sasha\u2019s way of thinking, I could relate to her frustration and confusion. I shared my story with her and told her that I too had found it hard to trust that God\u2019s plan for me was better than my own.Then I explained that, after eventually accepting that God\u2019s way\u00a0_was_\u00a0better, and asking Jesus to help me overcome the things I struggled with, I was eventually able to find freedom in that choice, as well as peace, hope and joy in my relationship with Him.To further illustrate my point, I shared a video from my yesHEis app with Sasha called \u201cWhat Are You Living For?\u201d. I love this video because it talks about living with an eternal perspective, not an earthly one.After a few minutes, Sasha messaged me back with,> \u201cThanks for sharing the video with me I really loved\u00a0it\u201dWe started meeting up for coffee weekly to chat about what a relationship with Jesus involved, then she started coming to church regularly, joined a life group, and after months of praying together, led her boyfriend to accept Jesus as his saviour too!While I may never know what prompted Sasha to confide in me that night, I do know that the yesHEis video I shared impacted her."

        "body": "A few days ago I was reminded about a time of \u201cshifting\u201d that took place in my life. I was part of a group who had been preparing for a tour that was going to present the gospel throughout NZ back in 2004, and the tour had finally started. Stories of miracles were already coming in, and I was getting stirred. I felt unsettled, like something inside of me needed to break free. I remember having the thought, that I needed to do something drastic.I made a decision in that moment to set some time aside to pray and fast! I was new to the idea, this was the first time I had ever done this, and it was the start of something \u2018unravelling\u2019 in me. The tour came to my city only weeks later, and on the first night people flooded to the front to receive Jesus, there was not even enough room for everyone to come forward. This is what we had been praying for!I felt like I was ruined for the ordinary that night, I stood there aghast, tears rolling down my face, as I witnessed hundreds surrender to\u00a0Jesus.There, God spoke to me and I knew it was time for me to change direction. Within weeks I was in my manager\u2019s office handing in my resignation. I sold my belongings and headed to Perth, Australia to start training in what would be a 10 year journey of a life as a missionary. My story might seem extreme, or perhaps that it could only happen to the few. I agree that it may appear that way, but I know that God has a special purpose and journey for each of us. It will look different for every person, but I believe we are all meant to be ruined for the ordinary.God has taken me on a journey, praying for people in other nations, that they will come know Him. This has included days of prayer, fasting, and crying out to Him to see the lost saved. He\u2019s changed me! The funny thing is, many of the things I\u2019ve prayed for, He\u2019s actually chosen me to be part of the solution. I\u2019ve learnt that no matter what, I can trust God. His heart breaks so much more than mine for the lost. I am compelled to be obedient to whatever He calls me to.So what does this have to do with prayer and fasting? Everything!There are things happening in world that are not ok. Since the fall, it\u2019s always been that way, however we see in Scripture there are many times when God\u2019s people have prayed and fasted they\u2019ve seen breakthrough. Let\u2019s look at a few examples: Daniel was moved to pray and fast because of the destruction of Jerusalem\u200a\u2014\u200a[Daniel 9:3]Nehemiah set aside time to pray and fast, because of the opposition Judah experienced for the rebuilding of Jerusalem\u200a\u2014\u200a[Nehemiah 1:4]In Acts, before Barnabas and Paul set out on their mission to take the gospel into the world, they prayed and fasted\u200a\u2014\u200a[Acts 13:3\u20134]Before you go, ask. Pray. \u201cThe harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.\u200a\u2014\u200a[Luke 10:2]Where is God calling you to? Is God moving you to pray and fast to take you deeper with Him so you can see the lost come to know Christ? Perhaps you can invite a few of your friends to join too?**I\u2019ve learnt over these years that nothing happens, unless it first happens in the place of prayer. Prayer changes us and it has the power to change the lives of people around us.**"

When I was at school\u200a\u2014\u200aeven though my friends knew that I was a Christian and that I went to church every Sunday\u200a\u2014\u200aI found it really tricky to share my faith in meaningful ways. It\u2019s like the familiarity I had with my friends created a distance, and sharing my faith got seriously \u201cfriend-zoned\u201d.At school you consistently spend 8 hours a day with the same core group of people, experiencing a variety of activities, making friendships and discovering life at a very pivotal point in developing your character. This is a rare opportunity that will most likely never happen again in your life, which is why I believe that school is a major opportunity for long-term, relational evangelism.**So how can you start a meaningful conversation about Jesus?**1. **Build solid friendships**\u200a\u2014\u200apeople don\u2019t care how much you know until they know how much you care. Being a reliable friend speaks volumes about who Jesus is, and you\u2019ll be the one your friends turn to when they\u2019re going through a hard time.2. **Float the offer\u200a**\u2014\u200aopen the door to future conversations about Jesus. Have you ever said to your friend \u201cHey, obviously you know that Jesus means a lot to me. You know I\u2019m here to chat if you ever want to know more.\u201d As you continue to do life together this will pave the way for future opportunities to share about who Jesus is to you without it being weird.3. **Be vulnerable**\u200a\u2014\u200ayou probably share the ups and downs of your faith life with your friends at church, so why not share them with your friends at school? Authenticity is super attractive, and as you\u2019re vulnerable with your life, it will encourage your friends to be vulnerable with theirs as well.The bottom line is, get in there! It says in 1 Peter 3:15\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cAlways be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.\u201dDon\u2019t be shy, open your mouth and honestly share about the hope that you have!"

When God sent his most beloved Son to be mocked, betrayed and to die the most brutal death to have us back in the fold of his love, it was reckless!_Luke 15__1Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 2But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, \u201cThis man welcomes sinners and eats with them.__3Then Jesus told them this parable: 4\u201cSuppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn\u2019t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?5And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders6and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says, \u2018Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.\u20197I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent._His love isn\u2019t cautious of the consequence, but instead chases after the one sinner who\u2019s lost. His love is unfailing even when we fail to love him back. It does not keep a record of our wrong doing. We are not defined by our mistakes. We are defined by the love of God regardless of our mistakes.There\u2019s nothing that He won\u2019t do for us. The only thing he wants in return is that we surrender our hearts to him.As Christians we are sealed and set apart by this love.

People like Martin Luther King Jr, Mother Teresa, or Nelson Mandela. People of great courage and tenacity. People who knew that the pain of change was not as bad as the pain of staying the same. People who waged peace and made a difference. They have led the way and forged paths which we ought follow.And while in the past, the media gave the microphone to these select few, nowadays social media has given a megaphone to the masses. This allows us as Christians to stand for what we believe in and to use our collective voice to make a collective difference. The question is, what are we saying and what will that difference be?Peace, like love, has collected varying meanings throughout time. We have an opportunity in our time to declare the true meaning of peace through our words and actions and introduce people to Jesus, the original peacemaker.> Everything Jesus did pointed to peace. In fact His reason in coming to earth was to bring\u00a0peace.Where people mourned and experienced pain and heartache\u200a\u2014\u200aJesus brought them peace, comfort and healing. When the religious gathered to stone a woman who had broken the law\u200a\u2014\u200aJesus offered her peace, forgiveness and justice. For those haunted with fear, regret or doubt\u200a\u2014\u200aJesus extended peace, freedom and restoration.This same peace is still available and accessible today and we are called to extend it to the world. The truth is, we cannot truly encounter Jesus and not become a peacemaker. Being a peacemaker is part of being surrendered to God, because God brings true peace.> We are called to be peace MAKERS, not peace\u00a0KEEPERS.Peacekeepers keep peace from a place of fear through avoidance. Peacemakers restore peace from a place of strength through reconciliation.As ambassadors of Jesus, and agents of peace it is time to step up and take personal responsibility to bring peace to our communities and cities. This will not be easy. It will require conviction, diligence, perseverance, and a willingness to step out of our comfort zones and model Jesus so others can step into their destiny with Jesus, but it will be worth it!**Are you ready?

Being 3 years his senior, I thought he was an easy target and I bullied him for no reason. I didn\u2019t treat him like a person; I would physically and verbally abuse him whenever I felt like it. I had a sense of control over him as I could even force him to do personal errands for me. There was nothing wrong with Julian, he was a typical student who took his studies seriously yet I still went out of my way to make fun of him in front of crowds. To me, he was mere prey at the bottom of the food chain.2 years after, I met Jesus at the lowest point of my life. **I hit rock bottom and came to my senses that I had nowhere else to go but towards Him.** I had a 180-degree life transformation and understood that I had to let go of my selfish and arrogant ways.** As I grew in my faith, realized and took to heart the call to serve others in the way Christ served His disciples.\u00a0**Because of this, I started to post about my personal experience and testimony on social media. True enough I got a lot of mixed reactions; some people found me funny, weird, good, etc. They were probably thinking, _\u201cHow can such a bad guy say things about how good God is?\u201d_\u00a0> Despite the good and the bad reactions, I was at peace because I knew that I am forgiven and saved by God\u2019s\u00a0grace.\u00a0As I continued to post and share about my newfound faith, _Instagram_ released a \u201cStories\u201d feature and I was so into it. I thought it was such a cool way to connect with people so I freely posted about not just my daily life, but also my faith and activities in church.One night as I was scrolling through Instagram a notification popped up\u200a\u2014\u200ait was Julian! He replied to of my random Stories and connected with me. **Despite me being a bully to Julian (among others), he still treated me with respect that I knew I didn\u2019t deserve. **Memories immediately flashed of how I used to be so mean to him. I knew what kind of person I\u2019ve been to Julian so I quickly prayed to God. I asked the Lord to humble my heart so that I could sincerely apologize for all the things I\u2019ve done in the past. As I apologized, he told me that it was nothing to him and that he forgave me a long time ago. It was sad to hear that for him, bullying was nothing new.> I feel relieved knowing that he didn\u2019t hold a grudge against me but I knew that I couldn\u2019t just stop there. I had to reach\u00a0out.Soon after that conversation, Julian messaged me once again asking If I could go with him to attend my church, _Christ\u2019s Commission Fellowship_. That\u2019s where our discipleship journey began. **Julian started to attend our weekly Discipleship group where we both learned more about God and accountability.\u00a0**No matter how bad our past may be God can always use it for His glory. It took me a leap of faith and obedience to say a simple \u201cSorry\u201d. It wasn\u2019t easy!\u00a0> The best way to learn humility is if we allow ourselves to acknowledge how sinful we are and realize we don\u2019t deserve forgiveness yet we are offered it by Jesus Christ Himself. It\u2019s only by God\u2019s grace that He allowed me to experience this wonderful relationship with Julian as a brother in\u00a0Christ.\u00a0If I kept silent about my testimony I might have missed the opportunity to be an ambassador for Christ on Julian\u2019s Instagram feed. **Social Media is an effective platform to proclaim the Life-changing power of the Holy Spirit.\u00a0**You have access online, _use it._By Jerrel Pilarta"

I often type out something that I have just prayed for them, and I send a video that links well to their circumstances, or one to give them a bit of encouragement.

I kid you not, I did this with a stranger the other day! I only did it cause I suddenly got the idea while I saw this girl sitting scrolling; so I took that as a God prompt! I went up to her and said, \u201cexcuse me, I don\u2019t usually do this but could I share a video with you?\u201d She asked what the video was about and I told her it was about purpose and the meaning of life. Her response was \u201coh I\u2019ve been thinking about that question a lot\u201d. How cool is that? God totally set that one up! I ended up getting her phone number and texting it to her, and letting her know I was happy to answer any questions she had.**4.

After all, we\u2019ve all seen social posts where a bit of love shared could go a long way. So don\u2019t be creepy or weird, but connect with what the person has said, give them some unsolicited encouragement, and share a video of hope to go along with it! Then let the video do the talking for you. You can always take the conversation private once you\u2019ve connected.**5. AirDrop\u00a0away!**(Sorry Android peeps, this one only works for iPhones)\u200a\u2014\u200aha ha I did this one with a bit of fear and trembling the other day. I was on a train and I had this weird idea so just went with it. I opened up the yesHEis app, got my fav video (it\u2019s called \u2018Falling Plates\u2019) and waited for a name to appear on AirDrop. I hovered my finger over the name for a bit, plucked up enough courage, then BAM! Done! Would you know it, it was the girl sitting right beside me! \u201cAre you Tiana?\u201d I asked with a smile as I saw her reach for her phone. And bingo! We had a quick chat and a laugh as I told her I thought she might want a cool video to take a look at. She accepted the \u2018drop\u2019, and by that time, the train had reached its destination to the city.

        "body": "When a friend has depression it can be hard to know what to do or say. It can be uncomfortable, confronting, and easy to begin hoping that someone else will step in to help them through it.But then we look at Jesus, and we see Him being fully present, fully engaged, and fully available for people no matter the circumstance.> In your friend\u2019s darkest hour, you can be\u00a0Jesus.[Anna Mannarino](https://relevantmagazine.com/author/annabelcher/), writer at\u00a0[Relevant Magazine](https://relevantmagazine.com/), speaks from a place of personal experience when sharing advice on this topic. After suffering through depression herself, here is what she has to say to others who may not know how to help their friends through depression, but want to:##### 1. DON\u2019T\u00a0JUDGE._Despite the flakiness, or the confusion I may cause. Please don\u2019t judge me. Pray that your heart will be filled with grace for me._##### 2. DON\u2019T TELL ME TO BELIEVE THINGS I ALREADY\u00a0KNOW._I know God is good. I know He works everything for good for those who love Him. I know I should find joy in God. And I know it is good to be reminded of these things, but please tread carefully. I know these truths should thrill my soul, but right now my soul is wounded. It isn\u2019t a lack of faith or unbelief. Please don\u2019t imply that my spiritual deficiencies are the cause of my depression._##### 3. LEARN TO\u00a0LISTEN._I will express my pain in wrong ways. I need you to tell me true things, but first I need to know that I have been heard. Don\u2019t immediately shoot me down. After actively listening to me, you can attempt to correct my faulty thinking, By this point, I may actually be able to hear you, because I feel heard._##### 4. DON\u2019T TRY TO FIX\u00a0IT._You can\u2019t. There is nothing you can say that can convince me to be happy, and most attempts will lead to frustration on both sides._##### 5. SIT WITH\u00a0ME._What I need most is someone who is willing to sit with me in my darkness. Hold me while I cry. Only after you hear me and hold me will there be any chance that I can hear the truth._##### 6. IF YOU GIVE ADVICE, BACK IT UP WITH\u00a0SUPPORT._Tell me to do something only if you are prepared to hold my hand through it. If that is too much commitment, don\u2019t give the advice. I am weary of hearing what I should do without the strength to do it. I don\u2019t need cheap words. I need someone who is willing to sacrifice his or her time and comfort to something they truly believe will be helpful to me._##### 7. PRAY FOR ME AND WITH\u00a0ME_There are several reasons why this is good:__Practical reason: If you pray with me right now, both of us know that your well-intentioned promise to pray is not taken up by life\u2019s little urgencies.__Relational reason: Hearing you plead with God for me gives me another opportunity to feel heard. When I hear you tell God what I\u2019ve told you, I know you have paid attention.__Like everything else, don\u2019t expect immediate fixes from prayer. We serve a powerful God, a God who heals, but as far as I can see, He usually heals depression gradually._You can read Anna\u2019s\u00a0[full article](https://relevantmagazine.com/life/how-help-friend-fight-depression)\u00a0at\u00a0[RelevantMagazine.com](https://relevantmagazine.com/)And if you don\u2019t quite know how to start a conversation about all this with your friend, we have some great content on depression and anxiety in our\u00a0video Library search for it in the app today."

        "body": "\u201cArthur Stace, a reformed alcoholic and convert to Christianity, spent 37 years writing in chalk on Sydney\u2019s footpaths the one word sermon \u201cEternity\u201d, and he wrote it more than half a million times!He started early, usually before dawn\u00a0,and he wandered through all the streets of Sydney. Every morning he was somewhere else, Wynyard, Glebe, Paddington, Randwick, Central Station. As he said\u200a\u2014\u200awhere God directed him. Every night the message appeared in his head. He was a very little man, bent, grey-haired, only five feet three inches tall and just seven stone. He looked frail enough to blow away. Then with the formality of another generation he always wore a grey felt hat, tie and prim double-breasted navy blue suit. Sometimes in the dawn light he would be seen around Wynyard Station. He would nod to the drunks still left on the pavement and he would look at the debris of the affluent society stretched out on the park benches, trying to keep warm under newspapers. If he detected any movement there would be a pat on the head or a warm greeting. He had the air of a man who understood.As he walked every so often he would stop, pull out a crayon, bend down and write on the pavement in large, elegant copperplate\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cEternity\u201d. He would move on a hundred yards then write it again, \u201cEternity\u201d, nothing more, just one simple word.He did not like publicity. He regarded his unique style of evangelism as a serious mission, something between Arthur Stace and his Maker, so for a decade these Eternity signs mystified Sydney.\u201d\u00a0_(The above is an exert from a book By Keith Dunstan )_Arthur Stace described his life-changing experience at the Burton Street church in an interview with the\u00a0_Daily Telegraph\u00a0_in 1965, two years before his death:John Ridley was a powerful preacher and he shouted, \u2018I wish I could shout Eternity through the streets of Sydney.\u2019 He repeated himself and kept shouting, \u2018Eternity, Eternity\u2019, and his words were ringing through my brain as I left the church. Suddenly I began crying and I felt a powerful call from the Lord to write \u2018Eternity\u2019. I had a piece of chalk in my pocket, and I bent down right there and wrote it. I\u2019ve been writing it at least 50 times a day ever since, and that\u2019s 30 years ago\u00a0\u2026 I think Eternity gets the message across, makes people stop and think.The tag \u201cEternity\u201d is best known to Australians by its prominent display on the Sydney Harbour Bridge during Sydney New Year\u2019s Eve 1999\u20132000, it was also displayed in the opening ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympic Games.The momentum has continued with the \u201cEternity\u201d gallery in the National Museum of Australia, named after Arthur Stace. The thought behind \u2018Eternity\u2019 is suggestive of the timelessness of stories, and embodies the message that all people have a story to tell, with one word or with many.\u201cEternity\u201d is also a newspaper published in Australia by the Bible Society, with content covering: personal testimonies, missionary news, book excerpts, social justice, and perspectives on popular culture\u2026..and you guessed it\u2026.named after Arthur Stace, and there are many others also.> _Arthur Stace didn\u2019t look for a name or for prominence, he was concerned for one thing, to do what his heavenly Father directed him to\u00a0do._Many of us will not receive a name or prominence here on earth, but what we do will effect eternity for both ourselves and others.[Matthew 16: 24\u201325](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A+24-25&version=NIV)\u00a0shows us clearly what we are to do as a follower of Jesus.Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cAll who want to come after me must say no to themselves, take up their cross, and follow me. All who want to save their lives will lose them. But all who lose their lives because of me will find them\u201d.Can I encourage you to ask God today, \u201cHow are you directing me, what am I to do?\u201d Everyone\u2019s message will be different, but what message are you sharing?"

        "title": "Bear Your Message Well",
        "body": "Everyday and through every possible avenue, we are told to look within ourselves in order to discover who we truly are and what we were put on this earth to accomplish and become. It\u2019s an age-old pursuit that did not begin (nor will it end) with our generation. Even as Christians, to echo this message is a real temptation. The bandwagon of self-discovery is vibrant and everyone on it seems to be on top of things, masters of their own destinies, living full aesthetically pleasing lives.\u00a0In fleeing from this temptation, where do we turn? How do we navigate thru a culture that places a premium on the message you put out into the world and the platform through which you do it? To spell out what has now become an \u201cold school\u201d acronym\u2026_what would Jesus do?_ He left a treasure trove of pointers, but for the benefit of our hyperactive attention spans, let me mention three:##### Practice self-denial until it becomes second\u00a0nature.Another way to put it would be to embrace the fact that you _are_ a new creation, able to submit to self-denial with boldness and joy through the power of the Holy Spirit. I write this fresh off the news of the passing of Eugene Peterson, pastor and author of The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language. In his 2012 memoir _The Pastor_, he wrote,\u00a0> \u201cResurrection does not have to do exclusively with what happens after we are buried or cremated. It does have to do with that, but first of all it has to do with the way we live right now.\u201d\u00a0He goes on to write about **dying to self** and how it is through this practice of surrendering living life by our own terms that we are able to fully experience resurrection power in the present time. In **Matthew 16:25 **Jesus tells his disciples,\u00a0> \u201cFor whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\u201d\u00a0> As we practice denying ourselves on a daily basis, the more receptive we become to what God is speaking into our lives, and the clearer we hear what His specific will and purpose for us\u00a0is.##### Discern the message that God desires for you to put out into the\u00a0world.\u00a0The Gospel message is powerful in and of itself. It stands firm apart from our willingness to bear it or not, but God\u2019s heart is for us to take part in His incredible story of redemption and grace.> \u00a0A genuine understanding of the Gospel will surely lead you to the conclusion that it is the most undeniably compelling message we could possibly\u00a0spread.\u00a0In giving the great commission to his disciples, who were common folk like you and me, Jesus said,_ \u201cGo into all the world and proclaim the Gospel to the whole creation.\u201d _(Mark 16:15)\u00a0> God is able to use you\u200a\u2014\u200athe good, the bad, and the seemingly uninteresting parts included\u200a\u2014\u200aas a message bearer of His good news. Is His message the message you would like your life to\u00a0bear?##### Devote yourself to echoing that message with boldness and humility.\u00a0There will always be more than enough ways to do it, but t_he challenge is to steward well both the message and the platform that God gives us to proclaim it._ Culture tells us that we are entitled to our opinions and the open hand with which we share them.\u00a0> But to further the cause of Christ is a privilege we do not deserve apart from Christ Himself, so we must be cautious, always keeping our thoughts and emotions in\u00a0check.\u00a0Paul, who wrote thirteen of the New Testament books, shows us what it means to bear the Gospel message boldly, humbly, and well. In his first letter to the Corinthians he wrote,\u00a0> \u201cBut by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.\u201d (15:10)\u00a0His platforms included royal courts, jail cells, and secluded islands but he wasn\u2019t one to nitpick what he thought would be the best possible way to proclaim the Gospel. **He knew he was just an instrument and was determined to be as useful as he could be for the Lord.**Ultimately, we look to Jesus who first modeled self-denial, discernment, and devotion for us. _\u201cFor I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of Him who sent me.\u201d _(John 6:38) His bandwagon may look nondescript at first glance, devoid of any bells or whistles, far removed from what culture defines as captivating\u200a\u2014\u200abut really, isn\u2019t that the beauty of it?Written by Andy Portugal"

        "body": "Starting a God conversation or turning a conversation towards Jesus may seem daunting, but don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s why I am writing this article.I will assume you can make conversation. Not spiritual conversation, just general conversation. If you have that under control, you are in the prime place to turn the conversation towards Jesus.The old saying: _\u201cPeople don\u2019t care what you know until they know that you care\u201d_ comes into play here.The first step to turning a conversation to Jesus is to establish trust and show that you care. In conversation listen firstly to \u2018what\u2019 they are saying and secondly to \u2018why\u2019 they are saying it.The second step is to ask questions that go a little deeper. If they are facing difficutly in a situation, ask questions that help them explain how the situation has made them feel. You could ask: \u201cHow has this made you feel?\u201d or \u201cAre you coping through this?\u201d or \u201cHow has this affected you?\u201dWe\u2019re all human, and often we can relate to other people\u2019s difficulties. Once you know what\u2019s happening and have spent time listening, ask if you can share a story about how you got through a similar situation, and explain how God helped you through it. (Remeber this is a two way conversation, so don't go in to preach mode. Speak \u2018with\u2019 them, rather than \u2018at\u2019)Now that God is a part of the conversation, ask if you could pray that He would come through in their situation. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable to that that you could also ask them about their experiences with God to continue the conversation."

To be honest there wasn\u2019t much in me that ever wanted to travel until God changed me that was!So what happened? I\u2019m a story girl, perhaps deep down we all are. A story of suspense and drama makes for some good reading (or a good movie), but to actually be in the story sometimes can be a different matter. There\u2019s a tendency to want to jump to the end to see how it all ends. So here begins my story if you\u2019re ready for a ride?I used to miss my home, even after being away for a night. I don\u2019t really know what it was that triggered those thoughts in me, but I noticed them often. I\u2019d arrive at my destination and as soon as it came time to go to bed, all I wanted was to be back in my own place. I would talk to God about it and simply say, \u201ccan you help me, can you change me?\u201dI had made a commitment to follow Jesus, to give Him the driving seat and surrender myself to His direction. I had fallen in love with Him. But it wasn\u2019t like there was a big bang or flash of lights and\u200a\u2014\u200aboom\u200a\u2014\u200aI was changed. No, it was gradual. I was being wooed to something more.From the moment I had made that commitment, I started to see things differently, and the people around me differently as well.> If God could change me, He could certainly change the people around me.I had been taken from darkness to light, and I wanted people around me to know that truth for themselves too. Not because I had it all together, far from it, I was a struggling mess at times\u200a\u2014\u200alike a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump from, (but I knew a jump from the ride would take me back into a much darker place).> The problem is when we miss the process, we basically start the roller coaster journey again.So, I decided to pull the emergency stop, I couldn\u2019t waste any more time on a circular roller coaster ride. I had to get on a ride that actually had a destination. That meant making some significant changes to my lifestyle so I was 100% surrendered to Jesus. I needed people with me on that journey, so here\u2019s what I did;I found a friend  The friend I picked was someone I decided to target. Sounds creepy I know, but her and I laugh at the process now. I honestly don\u2019t think she wanted to spend that much time with me as I poured my heart out to her looking for some accountability. If we were ever talking in the car, most of the time I could see her hand slowly move to the door handle, ready to escape and get out!But I saw a kindness in my friend, and whether she knew how to disciple me or not, I was going to be open and go along with the process. I was hearing from God, He was showing me what I needed to do, but I just needed a friend alongside me to cheer me on. In the end, it was mutual and we both grew in our faith. We\u2019ve now ended up besties, where even though distance and years of not being around each other, the deep heart connection and friendship remains.I told my story and built connections  I\u2019d had enough of trying to look like I had it all together, because the truth is, I was struggling. Not with everything; I had success in many areas, but to focus only on success is a lie.We\u2019ve all got weak points, we all have struggles, and we all respond to those struggles in different ways. So I brought everyone along the journey with me, (and by that I mean _everyone)_. Because what did I have to hide? And what did I have to lose?> If the book of my life was not open, how could people read it?That means that a lot of people know my stories, all to varying degrees. Some people aren\u2019t interested in the whole book, and hey, that\u2019s ok! We can\u2019t connect with everyone on a deep level, but are our true titles showing?> There\u2019s nothing worse than opening up a book with an exciting title and cover, only to find a whole lot of nothing inside\u2026I wanted _real_, and people wanted _real_. So as I connected with _real_, all sorts of exciting things started happening. People started being real with me, opening up in ways they would never open up. How did I know that? They used to tell me! Life was getting exciting.So what does all this have to do with missions?  The constant wooing of my heart, in love with Jesus, and wanting to spread the news of that, had caused a longing. My heart had started yearning for more! I\u2019d find myself dreaming of going to foreign lands to reach more people with the good news\u200a\u2014\u200abut what was I thinking!? I couldn\u2019t even leave home for a night! Or could I?Without even realising what I had done, it suddenly dawned on me. During the renovation of my home, I was staying with a friend and literally living out of a suitcase for weeks\u200a\u2014\u200aand I hadn\u2019t even missed my home!> God had changed my heart, he had removed my unfounded fear and had set me on fire with a passion to share Him.I would come alive as I heard reports of people coming to know Jesus. My mind and my heart started dreaming. I saw people, I saw nations, and I had started to cry for those nations.It didn\u2019t take a missions trip to spark my love for the nations, in fact, it was the total opposite. In taking the small, sometimes very wobbly, but faithful day by day steps with Jesus, I had searched for more, I had shared my story, and people had come to know Jesus along the way.> I had pushed forward expecting change, not waiting, but moving\u200a\u2014\u200alittle by little, and sharing my journey along the way!It wasn\u2019t the longing for missions that changed me, it was God that expanded my heart for the nations as I fell in love with Him. Since then I\u2019ve travelled to many nations, I\u2019ve personally led hundreds of people to Jesus; corporately with others that I\u2019ve gone together with, it\u2019s been thousands of people that have come to know Jesus personally. My heart beats for the nations to come to know Jesus.Missions trips are great, but don\u2019t wait for a missions trip! God wants to use you today, right now, right where you are!What has God put in front of you now? What is He wooing you into? Start sharing Him right where you are, and He will lead you into places you previously couldn\u2019t even dream of."

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Read the Bible?",
        "body": "For many years I ran \u2018New Christian Classes\u2019 in my local church. I loved it! Being able to disciple people in the early steps of their new found relationship with Jesus was an honour. The classes were based on 3 habits which are key to spiritual growth and spiritual maturity. Those habits were:Habit 1:\u00a0Daily time with God  Habit 2:\u00a0Regular time with other Christians\u00a0  Habit 3:\u00a0Giving of yourself> The foundational habit for all spiritual maturity is having a daily time with God. Nobody can do this for you, it is a habit you must cultivate for yourself.A huge part of daily time with God is time spent reading the Bible. With that in mind, let\u2019s look a how to read the Bible and apply it to your life.A core conviction of effective faith sharing Christians is that the Bible matters and that a life on mission is one solidified in the Bible.To help assimilate what you read in the Bible, it helps to have a journal handy to write out what you\u2019re learning. There are many effective way to read and journal the Bible, one particularly helpful method uses the acronym S.O.A.P.## S \u2014 ScriptureChoose a verse or verses from your daily reading and write them out in full.## O \u2014 ObservationNote down all the observations you can make about these verses of scripture. Ask and an answer questions like:- Who is writing/speaking?- Why are they writing/speaking?- Who are they speaking to?- What\u2019s the big idea that they\u2019re communicating?- How are people responding?- Are there any other parts of scripture that say a similar thing?You might also note down things you don\u2019t understand; questions you want to ask somebody about.## A\u2014ApplicationWrite down how you can apply what you\u2019ve read in your personal life. Ask and an answer questions like:- Does what I\u2019ve read change the way I perceive God, or others, or myself?- Are there attitudes I need to adjust; something I need to do, or stop doing?- Are there people I need to forgive or relationships I need to approach differently?- Is there a promise from God that I need to believe and put confidence in?Write down what you need to apply.## P \u2014 PrayerIt\u2019s impossible to live the Christian life except that God helps us. Take a moment to ask God to help you apply what you have read.If you are new to prayer, or prayer is a space you want t get better at, Here is another blog we have written called:\u00a0[How Do I Pray?](https://thejourney.yesheis.com/how-do-i-pray-cb8627dce6f4)> Having daily time with God can be really simple, as simple reading your Bible and\u00a0praying.These two habits are not really separate from one another; they work best when they flow together. As you read the Bible, pray and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you. Then as you read the truths in the Bible, pray and ask the Holy Spirit to teach you how to apply the truth in your life.As you live on mission why not use this model of Bible reading to disciple others in the early steps of their new found relationship with Jesus!"

While church is a great place to gather, it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let the mindset creep in that people need to come to church to get to know Jesus.> As a follower of Jesus, you are a living, walking, talking example of the church in\u00a0action.We see examples of this throughout the Bible. In the many places Jesus and his disciples went, they connected with people along the way.\u00a0[Acts 16:16\u201334](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A16-34&version=ESV)is a great example of the influence that Paul and Silas had with many people coming to faith.We recently chatted with *Tom on Messenger. After some conversation, he made a commitment to follow Jesus, and we got him connected into a local church. He was so grateful to have someone to chat to and have his questions answered. He commented at one point\u00a0_\u201cI have so many questions as maybe you can tell haha. It\u2019s actually quite hard to find Christians in everyday life on this end. \u201d_Who are the people in your world that don\u2019t know Jesus, that need to get to know you?

They both taught Enzo that there is only one true God. Enzo knew this was true but was also confused given his parents\u2019 religious differences. As such, Enzo thought he\u2019d mix the two together and get the best of both worlds.> He grew more and more curious and searched for online content about God, eventually stumbling upon a yesHEis YouTube ad which lead him to download the yesHEis app. After watching a few videos, Enzo found out that he could ask questions in the app as well. So he started asking questions.> This was in September 2017.> Our team rigorously responded to every question for months. The conversations eventually continued from the app to text messages. However, eventually, Enzo stopped messaging.> We heard nothing for months, until July 2018.> Suddenly, we received a text from Enzo. He had reached out to thank the yesHEis team for the support with his journey in finding out more about the Christian faith. He gave the news that he had accepted Christ as his Lord and Saviour and couldn\u2019t be happier!> Please thank God for Enzo and his journey and pray for more and more people to grow curious for Christ.What an encouraging story!A great reminder to keep praying for and reaching out to those who may seem cold toward faith, and a great reminder that some people take time to process faith."

        "body": "I can\u2019t tell you how many people ask us that question, or something similar, \u201cwhy does God hate me cause I\u2019m gay?\u201d.The truth is, God doesn\u2019t hate anyone. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite! He adores and loves every single person that He has created. That means everyone, including you!God wants relationship with you; no matter what you have done, are currently doing, or will do. No exceptions!I start with you, because unless you know that truth for yourself, you\u2019ll end up sharing a skewed message about who God is. There\u2019s more to the message, and it all starts with, \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d John 3:16Are you ready to share the truth?He wants the world to know that truth, and He wants everyone to know Him. So, I\u2019m writing this for you; if you\u2019re ready, if you know this truth, then please share the love, and help lead others into this same truth.Knowing God does not mean coming to God perfect\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s impossible! There is only one person who has walked this world as a perfect human, and that was Jesus himself. That\u2019s why it\u2019s only Jesus that can take away the sin of the world and reconcile us back to himself.Judgement is not for us, it\u2019s for God.Romans 2:1\u20134 says \u201cYou, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. Now we know that God\u2019s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God\u2019s judgment? Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realising that God\u2019s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?\u201dTruth and life is found in relationship with Jesus. When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aJohn 8:12God\u2019s abundant life and promisesFollowing God means a whole new way of living, it\u2019s an exciting journey. It\u2019s a complete exchange of life\u200a\u2014\u200asurrender of all that you are and all that you do to take up a new life following God\u2019s direction. The ending is a good one, a really good one, no-one else can fulfil this one, and no-one else can claim this promise\u200a\u2014\u200aeternal life! (1 John 2)That means a radical life change, in a love relationship with the Creator of the Universe. It\u2019s only in this love relationship that you can truly understand and know that love.Come just as you areWe can get it all wrong sometimes, thinking we need to do the changing ourselves and then let God in, but it\u2019s actually the other way around. The key is, it\u2019s your choice, a decision that only you can make;Believe in GodAccept what Jesus has done for youGive God control (that means total surrender to follow Jesus)In total surrender to God, the spirit of God living in you changes you from the inside out. It\u2019s you saying; \u201cHere I am, take me as I am, I give you control and I take up a new life in you\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s doing a 180 deg turn. You\u2019re going one direction, you turn and go in completely the opposite direction, from death to life.Are you ready for a conversation?I\u2019m sad when people ask the question \u201cWhy does God hate me cause I\u2019m gay?\u201d, because I\u2019m sad that they would think God hates them. Yet, at the same time, I\u2019m so pleased that people ask! It gives us the opportunity to talk, and ask how it is that they\u2019ve come to that conclusion. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for an open conversation, and to talk about the truth with them.So next time you get asked this question, or one similar to it, before you speak, can I suggest that you ask a question first? That question would be, \u201ccan I ask why you\u2019ve come to that conclusion?\u201d. You might be surprised at the answer.Looking for a video that helps explain everything Jesus has done for us?

        "title": "Faith Sharing Tip: Practice Resting In God\u2019s Peace",
        "body": "We live in a world full of restlessness, fear and instability. Yet, as Christians, Jesus offers us peace amidst it all.> \u201cI have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33> Peace is one of the greatest gifts God gave to\u00a0mankind.Yet, often we can feel far from peace. So how do we as Christians live from the place of peace that Jesus describes? Erwin McManus illustrates it well when he speaks about worship, and how genuine worship can create a shift of responsibility in our thinking.When we are feeling overwhelmed by life, feeling the stress, anxiety and the despair, McManus says it\u2019s because we have taken on responsibility for things that we do not have the power to carry.He explains that when we do this, it\u2019s like we pitch a horizontal roof over our life. When the rain falls, it gets heavy and our roof collapses. Yet, if we shift our roof to be more vertical, it causes the rain to pour off to the side and water all the fields around it, growing a harvest that eventually bares fruit.> Worshipping God teaches our soul to shift our roof vertically.This helps us to re-align our internal narrative to, \u201cThis is bigger than me. This is not mine to bare. I\u2019m going to give it to God.\u201dLet\u2019s practice and refine our soul worship, so that when the rain comes, we can continue to be peacemakers who create fruit within the storm."

        "body": "Misunderstandings, pre-conceived ideas, misconceptions \u2014 these are all part of a recipe to conflict. But the one thing to combat that conflict stew is connection! I\u2019m ashamed to admit this was a lesson I learned recently, and I was the one creating the conflict\u2026My husband and I bought our first house a year ago, so when the house next door to us went up for sale, we were excited about who our new neighbour could be. We even prayed and asked God for great opportunities to connect, and thought we\u2019d bake a fresh batch of cookies to take over and introduce ourselves.However when the sold sign popped up, the removalist truck did not. I was curious as to who this mysterious neighbour and his dog were with no furniture\u2026 just a man, his dog, and a white van.We were still waiting for the opportune moment to take over the cookies, but instead of that moment coming, the mysterious circumstances created distance between us and our new neighbour.A trip to the bathroom during the night showed that his lights were left on until morning, and my mind began to create scenarios that justified why it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to connect. My mother protection mode was strong.Why was he up at all hours of the night? What does he do with his white van? Why does his dog sound so aggressive when we walk by?Months went by. And instead of a connection with our new neighbour, I felt an unnerving conflict.Fast forward a few weeks later and I came home after a day at work. My husband had been looking after our 1 year old and had gone out for a walk. Seeing the neighbour on the way back from his walk, he introduced himself and got to talking.Long story short, my husband and our new neighbour found out they had a love for music in common, and we also discovered that he had been suffering from insomnia, which is why his lights were on at all hours of the night. We also learnt that, although he is an atheist, he is open to chatting about faith.Boom. Conflict dismantled! I learnt a great lesson that day.Who in your life have you unintentionally created conflict with? Maybe it\u2019s time to take steps to engage. Remember, peace is not a passive avoidance, it\u2019s in the nitty gritty of connection. So let\u2019s be peacemakers in our neighbourhoods."

He wrote:_\u201cHi I\u2019m Ben, I saw this app and something is telling me to install it. For every year of my life passed, I\u2019ve been trying so hard to stop the works of the devil in my life. I really need Jesus to change my story today, so I don\u2019t get fooled by satan anymore.\u201d_This is an open invitation (and believe it or not, these aren\u2019t uncommon). Ben got stopped by an ad to install our\u00a0[app](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/JSHS), not because he was wanting to share his faith, but because he wanted to know Jesus.> Every single day there are hundreds of thousands of people scrolling and looking for something more\u2026So quite simply, if we continue to put out open invitations for people to engage with content about Jesus, sooner or later someone will stop by for a look! Then the rest of the journey is about helping that person connect to Jesus.My response to Ben was; a friendly hello, direction to a video that could explain what following Jesus meant, and an offer to help answer his questions._\u201cYes I\u2019ve got lots of questions about how to be saved. I\u2019m going to call this app a \u2018Rescue Mission Fellowship \u2019cause I came in to be rescued that\u2019s all\u201d._I personally find videos to be an amazing way of bringing a visual explanation, and it saves me a\u00a0whole\u00a0lot of typing.\u00a0[Falling Plates](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/4x5X)\u00a0(inside our\u00a0[yesHEis\u00a0](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/JSHS)app) is a fantastic video that speaks powerfully to many people who watch it._\u201cI\u2019ve been a broken plate\u2026that\u2019s how my past was, which is broken to pieces\u2026\u201d_After a short discussion, I asked if Ben would like to make Jesus boss of his life, to which he answered\u00a0_\u201cI\u2019m ready\u201d_.

And honestly, that was probably the hardest part of this story. The reason being that;> People are after a relationship, they need connection. Without someone there to help, connection can get\u00a0lost.I\u2019ll expand on that a little more. The church were great; they welcomed him, prayed for him, he even filled in a connection card\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, I noticed he had ended up taking it home\u2026With a few gentle questions, he opened up to say he was struggling to connect and felt nervous. Who wouldn\u2019t?! It\u2019s a tough gig getting along to a church by yourself, meeting a whole lot of new people, and in an environment you\u2019re not familiar with.With a quick call to the church and forwarding through his contact details, that was all sorted. He\u2019s now got a Bible to read, a church to attend, and friends to connect with that know Jesus.And it doesn\u2019t stop there.

        "body": "So you finally worked up the courage to share your faith with a group of friends, and BOOM \u2014 there was that one friend who decided to be rude\u2026We\u2019ve all experienced this kind of situation before, so when we received this question from our yesHEis community, we knew it would be a common thread!Our advice is to, first up, remember\u00a0_whose_\u00a0you are and to not take it personally.> Remember your identity in Christ and ask God to help you lead the conversation to a healthier state.When someone responds negatively to a conversation, there\u2019s usually an underlying reason for it. Look past the response to understand\u00a0_what_\u00a0it is they are actually saying and\u00a0_why_\u00a0they are saying it.### Listen for the\u00a0keyWe once received a message from a guy who was swearing up a storm. But in the midst of the fiery language was the serious question,\u00a0_\u201cWhy do priests abuse boys?\u201d_See, if we\u2019re too busy being offended by the surface level stuff, we may miss the key to the underlying heart cry. Listening out for the key helps determine where to take the conversation.### Identify with\u00a0themWe were able to write back to this guy to say we were so pleased to hear from him and that he had asked a great question. We were able to agree with him and say that abuse of any kind is not ok, and that it breaks God\u2019s heart as well as ours.### Open the conversationThe next step after identifying with the person is to ask questions about what they have said. This can lead to them opening up about why they have responded in the way they have. In our conversation with the guy who wrote to us, we simply asked, \u201cHas something like this happened to you?\u201d Sadly, the answer was \u2018yes\u2019.So can you see how these three simple conversation steerers can really open up a conversation that has been previously shut down?Perhaps you can think of a friend or family member right now that has been hostile towards you in the past? Why not reach out to them today to have another go at a conversation!"

Originally written to honour soldiers overseas who longed to be home for the festive season, the song echoes a deeper spiritual sentiment of \u2018homecoming\u2019 that resides in every human heart.C.S. Lewis famously wrote, \u2018If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.\u2019We live in this world, but any fulfilment and desire we find here is only an echo of the perfect relationship between our Creator and creation that was lost in the Garden of Eden. As followers of Jesus, we know that this is the ultimate homecoming.For this homecoming to happen \u2014 whether in our own hearts or others \u2014 reconciliation is needed. A making of peace. The great news of the Christmas story is that it frames the character of God perfectly. Not as a stern Father with his arms folded, waiting for his disobedient child to come back and beg for forgiveness. It portrays the opposite \u2014 a loving Father offering forgiveness and reconciliation FIRST, waiting with his arms wide open.> This is the message of Christmas. \u201cCome\u00a0home\u201d.Not to an angry God who will discipline you, but to a loving Father with his arms wide open.The angels of Christmas are spot on \u2014 this IS good news of great joy. This is the God that the world needs to hear about.So this Christmas, let\u2019s take the opportunity to welcome people home. Let\u2019s not hold back from introducing people to the greatest homecoming story in all of history. The invitation of a creator God and Father to his beloved creation, to \u2018come home\u2019 and be reconciled in relationship with him."

        "title": "FAQ: Why Does God Allow Evil?",
        "body": "The dilemma of evil has haunted theologians, philosophers and everyday Christians for centuries. It is the ammunition loaded into the conversational guns of those who argue against Christianity.Nearly every day we hear about natural disasters, terrorism, and profound tragedies. Regardless of the situation, suffering from acts of evil always leave people shocked, grief-stricken, angry and numb. Tears flow freely and hearts carry deep ache for what has been taken from them.With pain so heartfelt, people naturally begin to ask questions like \u201cWhy does God allow evil to happen?\u201d or \u201cIf God is so powerful and so good, why is there so much suffering in the world?\u201d These are valid questions which deserve answers and in times of pain, should be answered with sincerity and truth.First things first  Before we can answer people\u2019s question of \u201cWhy does God allow evil?\u201d, we need to first determine what they believe about God. Asking the question, \u201cDo you believe God exists?\u201d will quickly determine their belief.If they don\u2019t believe God exists, or they are unclear as to who God is, then answering the question \u201cWhy Does God allow evil?\u201d becomes a fruitless discussion. Spend some time first sharing about who God is. If they do believe God exists, again it is best to spend time sharing about the character of God.> _Sharing about the character of God will help bring clarity and begin to answer the question of why God allows\u00a0evil._[Here](http://www.gotquestions.org/attributes-God.html)\u00a0are some verses which may help.The question of evil  It was the issue of evil that initially led author and scholar C. S. Lewis into atheism. However, upon further reflection, Lewis began to see that if there is no God, then there is no such thing as evil either. He wrote: \u201cEvil can only be known and measured against a standard of good. Apart from God and the morality that flows from Him there is no standard\u200a\u2014\u200aand therefore no evil either, but we know in our hearts, it\u2019s inescapable\u200a\u2014\u200athat evil is real.\u201d His conclusion that evil is real proved the existence of God.Free will  We are made in God\u2019s image ([Genesis 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=ESV)) and He has given us the free will to decide how we act and the ability to make moral choices ([Genesis 2:16\u201317](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A16-17&version=NIV)). Every one of us is capable of making selfish, self-centered and evil choices. Whenever that happens, people get hurt. Doing our own will is much more common and certainly much easier.> _We cannot blame God for the tragedy in our world, we must blame ourselves or those who have ignored who and what He\u00a0is._Created for purpose  God created us for a purpose ([Ephesians 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10)). He created us to know Him and to enjoy Him; to live and bring glory and honour to Him. If we look around at society, it is easy to see that humanity is not bringing glory to God. Rather there is a brokenness in the world. We see it in the evil of terrorism, we see it in war, violence, abuse, deceit and betrayal.The sin problem  In ignorance to God, we could search high and low for the reason of the brokenness, but the truth is, beneath it all, the problem is spiritual. Really, we are the problem ([Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:23)). We have not lived for God, we have not followed His rules, rather we have made our own. We have not valued a relationship with Him. The Bible calls this sin. Sin is running from God, trying to do life our own way. Sin is taking the title of God and putting it upon ourselves. It is because of sin that we as humanity have become hostile not only towards God, but towards others. The Bible says the consequence of sin is death.The righteousness of God  When we ask: \u201cIf God is so powerful and so good, why does he allow evil?\u201d we ask the wrong question. What we should be asking is; \u201cHow does a Holy and Righteous God, knowing the evil we thought, said or did yesterday, not kill us this morning?\u201d If we don\u2019t ask this question, we continue to avoid responsibility for the problem of sin. We think the problem is in God, not in ourselves.> _To state that God should hold off evil means we believe there is someone, somewhere, good enough who does not deserve the consequence of\u00a0sin._The supremacy of man  When you pose the question: \u201cWhy does God allow evil?\u201d, we ask from a position of belief in the supremacy of man, as if to say; \u201cHow dare God not deploy his power on behalf of almighty man.\u201d However, when we flip the question back onto ourselves, from a position of belief in the supremacy of God, we then respond with \u201cHow dare I deploy my power as though I am almighty God.\u201dThe real problem  Underneath it all, the real problem is you and me. The problem with evil and suffering is us. We in our free will have chosen to disobey God. We start with ourselves as the supreme being, not God. We judge God by how well He carries out our agenda for the world. We fall for the lie that we are the most important and as a result we want a God who is omnipotent (all powerful) but not sovereign (in authority). If God is omnipotent but not sovereign, He is at our mercy, but if God is both omnipotent and sovereign, then we are at His Mercy.> _God allows evil in the world, for if He was to remove it, He would have to remove us, as we are all inherently evil because of\u00a0sin._The character of God is that He is omnipotent and sovereign, but He is also loving and if we submit to Him, He is faithful and just, willing to forgive us of our sins and to purify us from all unrighteousness ([1 John 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:9)). It is in submission to Christ that we overcome evil.Rather than blaming God and questioning His rational on evil, we aught be thanking Him for His kindness and be about promoting His cure for evil and its consequences\u200a\u2014\u200aJesus Christ!Here are a few links to other websites on the topic:- [Why Does God Allow Evil?](http://stfi.re/blezga)- [How Can God Allow So Much Evil and Suffering?](http://stfi.re/kwzlng)"

        "title": "FAQ: How Can I Share My Faith with My Workmates?",
        "body": "When it comes to sharing our faith and impacting the environment around us, it can be hard to know what the best approach is. Especially in a work environment, where we often want to keep our faith private.But as Christians, sharing Jesus is something that should be a natural part of our lifestyle as we live out the Great Commission. So why is it that it can sometimes feel like such a challenge?## Here are a few thoughts that can help when it comes to sharing Jesus at\u00a0work:## 1. Point to\u00a0JesusOne of the biggest reasons we struggle to share our faith is that we often don\u2019t feel authentic enough ourselves. Maybe there is shame in our life and we think that we still need to reach a certain point of holiness before we start sharing about a holy God. But one truth that we need to remember is this.> You don\u2019t have to be Jesus\u200a\u2014\u200ayou just need to point to Him. There is a huge difference.Of course, the way we live our life and the decisions we make need to support the Gospel message, but we also need to understand that we will never be perfect. We are human! Why else does Jesus suggest we ask for forgiveness in the Lord\u2019s Prayer every day?The only difference between you and your non-Christian workmates is this: you are forgiven. Being forgiven changes everything. It makes us grateful and it sets us free from wanting to be perfect before we tell people about Jesus.## 2. Pray RegularlyIt was Reinhard Bonnke who said that \u201cEvangelism is a bomb, but prayer is the fuse\u201d. The two go hand in hand. So when it comes to sharing your faith with other people, prayer can\u2019t just be an option. When we pray, we move mountains. We release God\u2019s will over people.In\u00a0[John 6:63](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A63&version=NIV)\u00a0we read that\u00a0_\u201cit is the spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all.\u201d_\u00a0In other words, do not depend on yourself. Depend on Him to be with you and to guide your steps.Pray regularly that what you share will fall on open hearts and bring healing, love, and most of all, eternal life.## 3. Remember the Reason:\u00a0LoveSharing our faith should always come from a place of love, and we should never put any kind of pressure on people. Check that the words you are using are helpful and not hurtful, and remember that every person has a history that is completely unique. What we say should bless people, not judge them. And the way to do this doesn\u2019t often start with talking, it begins with listening.## 4. Share Your TestimonyBeing transparent about your own life is another great way to share your faith, as well as an opportunity to deepen the relationship. While people will sometimes connect through Bible knowledge, they will always connect through your personal story. And the great thing about sharing your testimony is that you can share what you have actually experienced in your own life. This makes what you say completely authentic, which is what people want to hear!## 5. It\u2019s a LifestyleSharing our faith doesn\u2019t have to be hard. It can be as simple as living a faith-filled life with integrity and having a heart to serve others. When in relationship with Jesus, opportunities to serve others always arise. And as followers of Jesus, we need to be available to participate in His plans for us. By living in this way, we can be salt and light in our workplaces, and our workmates will notice.So, be bold this week, and take a step towards sharing your faith with a workmate. You never know what God might do with it."

That twinge whispers to us that if we don\u2019t share Jesus today, we are somehow not keeping up with God\u2019s expectation.God\u2019s grace in salvation is an immeasurable gift by which we are eternally indebted. However, what if God doesn\u2019t expect us to attempt to pay back the gift of salvation? What if we actually can\u2019t receive the gift if we\u2019re also trying to pay it back?> Salvation isn\u2019t an I.O.U. It\u2019s an adoption certificate into God\u2019s\u00a0family.Salvation is an initiation to spend the rest of our lives (and then eternity) with Jesus. There are no \u2018should\u2019s\u2019, just opportunities to share the joy you already have because of Jesus. Relationship with Jesus is the point. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s adventurous and delightful. That\u2019s what we\u2019re sharing.It\u2019s like being adopted by a multi-billionaire. God has the means to provide for all your needs, and your neighbour, and your work friends. There is always room for an extra person at God\u2019s table, and room to join the family.We don\u2019t share because we must, we share Jesus because we want to. Jesus is the point of our life.

        "body": "The thrill of getting on a plane and heading off to a foreign land excites me now, but it never used to. To be honest there wasn\u2019t much in me that ever wanted to travel, until God changed me that was!So what happened? I\u2019m a story girl, perhaps deep down we all are. A story of suspense and drama makes for some good reading (or a good movie), but to actually be in the story sometimes can be a different matter. There\u2019s a tendency to want to jump to the end to see how it all ends. So here begins my story if you\u2019re ready for a ride?I used to miss my home, even after being away for a night. I don\u2019t really know what it was that triggered those thoughts in me, but I noticed them often. I\u2019d arrive at my destination and as soon as it came time to go to bed, all I wanted was to be back in my own place. I would talk to God about it and simply say, \u201ccan you help me, can you change me?\u201dI had made a commitment to follow Jesus, to give Him the driving seat and surrender myself to His direction. I had fallen in love with Him. But it wasn\u2019t like there was a big bang or flash of lights and\u200a\u2014\u200aboom\u200a\u2014\u200aI was changed. No, it was gradual. I was being wooed to something more.From the moment I had made that commitment, I started to see things differently, and the people around me differently as well.*If God could change me, He could certainly change the people around\u00a0me.*I had been taken from darkness to light, and I wanted people around me to know that truth for themselves too. Not because I had it all together, far from it, I was a struggling mess at times\u200a\u2014\u200alike a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump from, (but I knew a jump from the ride would take me back into a much darker place).*The problem is when we miss the process, we basically start the roller coaster journey\u00a0again.*So, I decided to pull the emergency stop, I couldn\u2019t waste any more time on a circular roller coaster ride. I had to get on a ride that actually had a destination. That meant making some significant changes to my lifestyle so I was 100% surrendered to Jesus. I needed people with me on that journey, so here\u2019s what I did;**I found a friend**  The friend I picked was someone I decided to target. Sounds creepy I know, but her and I laugh at the process now. I honestly don\u2019t think she wanted to spend that much time with me as I poured my heart out to her looking for some accountability. If we were ever talking in the car, most of the time I could see her hand slowly move to the door handle, ready to escape and get out!But I saw a kindness in my friend, and whether she knew how to disciple me or not, I was going to be open and go along with the process. I was hearing from God, He was showing me what I needed to do, but I just needed a friend alongside me to cheer me on. In the end, it was mutual and we both grew in our faith. We\u2019ve now ended up besties, where even though distance and years of not being around each other, the deep heart connection and friendship remains.**I told my story and built connections** I\u2019d had enough of trying to look like I had it all together, because the truth is, I was struggling. Not with everything; I had success in many areas, but to focus only on success is a lie.We\u2019ve all got weak points, we all have struggles, and we all respond to those struggles in different ways. So I brought everyone along the journey with me, (and by that I mean\u00a0_everyone)_. Because what did I have to hide? And what did I have to lose?*If the book of my life was not open, how could people read\u00a0it?*That means that a lot of people know my stories, all to varying degrees. Some people aren\u2019t interested in the whole book, and hey, that\u2019s ok! We can\u2019t connect with everyone on a deep level, but are our true titles showing?*There\u2019s nothing worse than opening up a book with an exciting title and cover, only to find a whole lot of nothing\u00a0inside\u2026*I wanted\u00a0_real_, and people wanted\u00a0_real_. So as I connected with\u00a0_real_, all sorts of exciting things started happening. People started being real with me, opening up in ways they would never open up. How did I know that? They used to tell me! Life was getting exciting.**So what does all this have to do with missions?** The constant wooing of my heart, in love with Jesus, and wanting to spread the news of that, had caused a longing. My heart had started yearning for more more! I\u2019d find myself dreaming of going to foreign lands to reach more people with the good news\u200a\u2014\u200abut what was I thinking!? I couldn\u2019t even leave home for a night! Or could I?Without even realising what I had done, it suddenly dawned on me. During the renovation of my home, I was staying with a friend and literally living out of a suitcase for weeks\u200a\u2014\u200aand I hadn\u2019t even missed my home!*God had changed my heart, he had removed my unfounded fear and had set me on fire with a passion to share\u00a0Him.*I would come alive as I heard reports of people coming to know Jesus. My mind and my heart started dreaming. I saw people, I saw nations, and I had started to cry for those nations.It didn\u2019t take a missions trip to spark my love for the nations, in fact, it was the total opposite. In taking the small, sometimes very wobbly, but faithful day by day steps with Jesus, I had searched for more, I had shared my story, and people had come to know Jesus along the way.*I had pushed forward expecting change, not waiting, but moving\u200a\u2014\u200alittle by little, and sharing my journey along the\u00a0way!*It wasn\u2019t the longing for missions that changed me, it was God that expanded my heart for the nations as I fell in love with Him. Since then I\u2019ve travelled to many nations, I\u2019ve personally lead hundreds of people to Jesus; corporately with others that I\u2019ve gone together with, it\u2019s been thousands of people that have come to know Jesus personally. My heart beats for the nations to come to know Jesus.Missions trips are great, but don\u2019t wait for a missions trip! God wants to use you today, right now, right where you are!What has God put in front of you now? What is He wooing you into? Start sharing Him right where you are, and He will lead you into places you previously couldn\u2019t even dream of."

        "body": "Starting a God conversation or turning a conversation towards Jesus may seem daunting, but don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s why I am writing this article.I will assume you can make conversation. Not spiritual conversation, just general conversation. If you have that under control, you are in the prime place to turn the conversation towards Jesus.*The old saying: \u201cPeople don\u2019t care what you know, until they know that you care\u201d comes into play here.The first step to turning a conversation to Jesus, is to establish trust and show that you care. In conversation listen firstly to \u2018what\u2019 they are saying and secondly to \u2018why\u2019 they are saying it.The second step is to ask questions that go a little deeper. If they are facing difficulty in a situation, ask questions that help them explain how the situation has made them feel. You could ask: \u201cHow has this made you feel?\u201d or \u201cAre you coping through this?\u201d or \u201cHow has this affected you?\u201dWe\u2019re all human, and often we can relate to other people\u2019s difficulties. Once you know what\u2019s happening and have spent time listening, ask if you can share a story about how you got through a similar situation, and explain how God helped you through it. (Remeber this is a two way conversation, so dont go in to preach mode. Speak \u2018with\u2019 them, rather than \u2018at\u2019)Now that God is a part of the conversation, ask if you could pray that He would come through in their situation. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable to that that you could also ask them about their experiences with God to continue the conversation."

Well in the context of sharing your faith, it translates to, \u201cDon\u2019t attack someone and then tell them the Good News of Jesus.\u201dHearing the Gospel can cause discomfort; whether that is an uneasiness or outright hostility from someone who doesn\u2019t agree.Pointing out the falsehoods in someone\u2019s religion or trashing their worldview only serves to put them on the back foot. Once they have adopted a defensive posture, no argument will hold ground, no matter how sound or true.> _Understanding someone doesn\u2019t mean you agree, but it does mean you care for the person regardless of their view, because you\u2019ve taken the time to understand._A wise man once wrote:\u00a0_If you try to take a bone from a dog, the dog will defend his bone with all the strength he has; but if you offer him a lovely piece of meat instead, the dog will drop the bone immediately.\u00a0_ Likewise, people will always defend their religions, opinions, and beliefs, because they know nothing better. Jesus is awesome, so whatever they\u2019re holding onto will not be as rewarding as relationship with Him. But they don\u2019t know that yet.As it says in\u00a0[Proverbs 15:1]\u00a0_A sensitive answer turns back wrath, but an offensive word stirs up anger._So keep the conversation on Jesus and the offer of salvation through relationship with Him, and steer away from negative themes."

True enough, these years turned my adulting to a whole new level**Little did I know that my growing up included transformation from the inside out. **A spiritual surgery to say the least. A lifesaving process that I never knew I needed.But God, in His goodness, graciousness, and greatness, allowed to be done in me.If living as a minority actually helped me to know myself better, living without my usual community made me connect with others better. Shipped out hundreds of miles away from home, technology and social media became necessities. Stripped of my usual devices or schemes, intentionality and creativity became norms.So _Facebook Messenger_, _Whatsapp_, _Telegram_, and even _Instagram_ caused me to save on long distance phone calls.\u00a0> But the best part was these tools created opportunities for me to share the Gospel and souls to be\u00a0saved.Looking back, the journey began with three things:1) when I _recognized the online space as a platform_ to express my faith,2) when I _realized the common needs _ and general identity of my social media network, and more importantly,3) when I _rested in the truth that I speak_ (type out my thoughts, to be precise) as an overflow.Of course, these did not happen in a straight line. I had hits and misses. Encouragements and attacks. Praises I needed to give back to God. And posts I wanted to take back! In all, there were many things I had to change in my heart.\u00a0> If there was one thing I needed to progressively deal with, it was preventing myself from \u201ccurating\u201d my online\u00a0life.\u00a0_(The danger of which, according to Josh McDowell, is that we will eventually curate the truths in our lives.)_ Thankfully, by having a constant intake of God\u2019s Word and learning from church, I have been learning to communicate my brokenness, authenticity and my identity in Christ, in real or virtual connections.Despite my gaps, God has been good to give me chances to share Him with others (and also for others to share more of God to me!). From a gay friend who considered joining a Christian community, a single mom friend who wanted to bring her son to Sunday School, a former schoolmate who needed a Biblical perspective on a religious tradition, plus countless people who ask for counsel and prayers. For most of these, all it took to start a spiritual conversation online was for me to share a Christian song or video. **Sometimes it was simply through storytelling **about my life overseas.\u00a0> But ultimately of course, it was yielding to the Holy Spirit, stepping out in faith, and trusting God for the\u00a0results._\u201cSuccess in witnessing is simply taking the initiative to share Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit and leaving the results to God.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aBill Bright, Founder, Campus Crusade for Christ_In all, what would have been Internet tools to keep my family and friends updated (and assured I am still alive), are being redeemed by God for His glory and His story in my life.By Guia Gonzales"

Whether it gives them courage or makes them want to give up, is all in what you say.> This is why my all-time favourite Bible verse about speaking comes from Ephesians 4:29 -\u201cLet no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers.\u201dNow that we know that our tongue is such a powerful tool, let\u2019s ask some questions \ud83e\udd14_1.

It is a mission that has been at play for thousands of years, and continues still today.Jesus is key to this mission. Through Him we are granted access to take part in it. His time on earth was significant. Why He came, what He did and how He did it, were all intentional moves by God inviting us into life in Him and exampling what that life on mission would look like.You would be familiar with the \u2018Great Commission\u2019 \u2014 the command of Jesus telling us to \u201cgo into all the world\u2026\u201d That is our call to take part in the mission. It is an honour that we can work with God as co-labourers in the great co-mission to tell and show people the good news of God\u2019s redemption story and how it applies to them today.Often we assume the call to \u2018go\u2019 is a call to \u2018missionaries\u2019 only. A call to those who will go and serve in the far corners of the globe, but the mission of God is too important to leave to missionaries alone. It is not just a mission for others, it is a co-mission with God and us. It is a personal call to each of us.Our commission is to go into the world, not over-to the world. That means that our call is to live on mission and take the message of Jesus INTO workplaces, conversations, university campuses, families and cultures not just other countries.In the same way that Jesus became a human and entered the neighbourhood to fulfil God\u2019s mission, we are invited with Jesus in us, to enter our individual neighbourhoods and live out the mission of restoring humanity back to God.> \u2018Missio Dei\u2019 is simply living out the message of Jesus in community knowing that God is also at work in the community.It is being aware of Gods mission while being on mission. Sometimes life on mission looks grand, and other days it looks grubby. Some days it is done with others and some days it is done alone, but it is never done without the Holy Spirit. He is centre to the strategy. In fact, it is our obedience to His prompting and guiding that ensures we are mission effective.> Life on mission isn\u2019t a task, rather a lifestyle and a commitment we graciously accept when we accept Jesus. Accepting Jesus is accepting the\u00a0mission.We are given both identity and purpose when we accept Jesus. We are both \u2018saved\u2019 and \u2018called\u2019 according to His purpose and mission. A mission which needs to be outworked not just in church, but in our homes, work places, neighbourhoods, schools, parks, street corners, grocery stores, phone calls and bus rides.If you have ever questioned what your purpose is, look to Jesus. He has already shown us! We are to join God in His great mission of restoring humanity to Him. The question is, are we being effective in our mission?_All the authority of the universe has been given to me. Now go in my authority and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And teach them to faithfully follow all that I have commanded you.

It\u2019s the necessary things that feed our spirit and grow our own relationship with God.Here are 4 basic habits to cultivate for a life on mission\u2026- Prayer \u2014 This is the most important. Prayer is talking with God. Prayer is asking and believing when things have yet to happen.- Read the Bible \u2014Reading daily is a good idea. Really. Don\u2019t read until the end of the chapter, read until God speaks to you. That might happen two verses in or two pages in. When you read your Bible that way, you can not put it down and walk away unchanged in some way.- Worship \u2014 This is looking at God with eyes and hearts wide open, so that we experience the God we love. It\u2019s breathtaking and mysterious.- Fasting \u2014 Fasting food particular has this ability to tune your spirit and enhance the experience of the other three above. If your prayer\u2019s feel dry, your Bible boring and your worship dull and shallow \u2014 fast. I promise you that you won\u2019t be disappointed if you persist."

It\u2019s always interesting though, even after years of following through with God\u2019s promptings, there can still be a nervousness and there is always the practical question, how do I do this?The answer was simple, \u201cJust go up to him, you\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d I\u2019ve learned not to over-think and just take a step of faith and trust God will be there with me, and He always is. little tips like this are key seeing more fruit in my life._Let me just pause the story here for a minute_Here are a few thoughts that are quite common to experience:- \u201cI may have not heard God right\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aYep, but I would rather step out than not- \u201cHow\u2019s he going to respond?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThere\u2019s only one way to find out- \u201cThis feels uncomfortable\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aOf course it will, but that is OK- \u201cPerhaps he might get the wrong idea of a girl saying hi\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI can quickly put him right if he does, it\u2019s a public place and I walk in fear of the Lord- \u201cI might get asked something I don\u2019t know the answer to\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThat\u2019s ok I don\u2019t need to have all the answers, and it\u2019s ok to say that. I can get back to him with an answer or refer him to someone who doesHere\u2019s one example of where Jesus sends the twelve disciples:\u201cDon\u2019t think you need a lot of extra equipment for this. You are the equipment. No special appeals for funds. Keep it simple and no luxury inns. Get a modest place and be content there until you leave.

I finished the short prayer and explained, \u201cThat tingling was a touch from God and there\u2019s more where that comes from\u201d.Rather than leave the conversation at that, I asked if he might be interested in knowing more about Jesus. I\u2019d recommend that you try the same technique in this situation. He wasn\u2019t sure, he needed time to process, but he gave me his mobile number so I could text him a link to a video about Jesus. I sent him one of the videos I had found in the\u00a0app\u00a0about Jesus. Within a day I had a text message back \u201cI would like to chat again (I think) when I\u2019m not so taken aback\u2026. it may not go anywhere I suspect but I\u2019m trying to grasp why me?\u201d I\u2019ve been able to continue the conversation with him, but I\u2019ll leave the rest of the story for another day.> Do you want to miss out on the joy of sharing the most amazing news, and bringing people another step closer to Jesus?

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Pray?",
        "body": "Prayer is one of the most powerful things we can do. The Bible talks a lot about prayer, so it\u2019s important we know how to do it. Especially because it is such a core part of living effectively \u2018on mission\u2019.> It\u2019s often overcomplicated, but at face value, prayer is simply just speaking with\u00a0God.How did Jesus pray? When asked, Jesus taught His disciples to pray in a particular way. His prayer is known as \u2018The Lord\u2019s Prayer\u2019 and is the perfect place to start when wanting to know how to pray.> \u201cOur Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.  Your kingdom come, Your will be done,  on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread,  and forgive us our debts,  as we also have forgiven our debtors.  And lead us not into temptation,  but deliver us from evil.[Matthew 6:9\u201313](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9-13&version=AMPC)In this prayer, Jesus gives us a list of key things to do when we pray, let me break down each section\u2026## Our Father in Heaven, hallowed (Holy) be Your\u00a0name:This reminds us that God is our Father (who lives in Heaven), and we are His children (who live on earth). He loves us very much and is very approachable about any topic, so we need not pray in fear. It also reminds us that God is God and we are not. We right-size God in our minds by contemplating His awesomeness. This helps us remember that He is in control.## Your Kingdom come, Your will be\u00a0done:This reminds us that our purpose is to see God\u2019s Kingdom expand on the earth. This is essentially praying that people who don\u2019t know God would come to know Him.\u00a0Doing this is extremely healthy, because it also keeps our eyes focused on others and allows God\u2019s love for people to grow in our heart. It also reminds us to surrender our will to Him, and ask God to lead us, rather than leading ourselves## Give us (today) our daily\u00a0bread:This reminds us to ask for what we need each day and be thankful for the tangible things in life. It can also mean spiritual revelation. If there is something about God or in the Bible that you don\u2019t understand, ask you to make the meaning clear to you.## Forgive us our debts (wrongs):This reminds us to ask for forgiveness for our wrongs while also reminding us to forgive those who wrong us. We need to forgive others in order for God to forgive us, so forgive them before God in prayer.## Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from\u00a0evil:This reminds us to ask God to strengthen us as we follow His will. Ask God to help you overcome temptation, break unhealthy life habits and choose His way for our lives. This is also a reminder to pray for God\u2019s protection from the plans of the devil to bring us harm.> Relationship with God is actually an ongoing conversation God. As you practice throughout the day, expect to see God do amazing\u00a0things.## Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for what you need, but notice how much emphasis God puts on outwardly directed\u00a0prayer.Prayer isn\u2019t just about our needs. Whether it is rightsizing God, listening for His voice to know His will, praying for others to know Him, or to forgive others. It\u2019s so much bigger than our own needs and desires.> Praying for those who don\u2019t know God is so important.We all know people who haven\u2019t yet made a decision to follow Jesus. God wants us to pray for them and encourage them to follow Him, so that their lives can be blessed by friendship with Him.As you pray, you will notice God will increase the love you have for those who don\u2019t yet know Him. Act on this love, and share with them about what God is doing in your life. An opportunity to know Jesus is the best gift you can give to anyone.Salvation is the first step to this exciting journey, and so you can help others embark on this first step in the God journey by sharing about Jesus with them.It starts with prayer."

        "body": "People\u2019s objections to faith are often because of bad experiences with religious people. They feel judged on a good/bad scale. Jesus said: \u201c_Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\u201d\u00a0_([Matthew 7:1\u20132](http://%E2%80%9Chow%20then%20shall%20they%20call%20on%20him%20in%20whom%20they%20have%20not%20believed/?%20And%20how%20shall%20they%20believe%20in%20Him%20of%20whom%20they%20have%20not%20heard?%20And%20how%20shall%20they%20hear%20without%20a%20preacher?%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%AD%E2%80%ADRomans%E2%80%AC%20%E2%80%AD10:14%E2%80%AC%20%E2%80%ADNKJV%E2%80%AC%E2%80%AC%20http://bible.com/114/rom.10.14.nkjv))Sadly, religious culture can be judgemental, and it can be hard to get out of, because right and wrong is embedded in our thinking.\u00a0[Judah Smith](https://twitter.com/judahsmith), in his book, \u2018[Jesus Is _____](http://www.jesusisbook.com/)\u2019 writes about this thinking:> \u201cHere\u2019s how I assure myself I\u2019m doing good. I make up rules to fit my standard of living, the I judge you by them. If you follow my rules, you\u2019re a good person. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a bad person. If you have stricter rules than me, you\u2019re a prude who needs to lighten up.\u201dWe create our own delusion by creating our own rules to make ourselves feel better because we haven\u2019t been as bad as others. However, God tells us we have all have sinned; we have all fallen short of the mark. Judah admits that his way of thinking is wrong. Can we do the same? If we can, we realise there is no need to avoid sinners. In fact there is a need to go out of our way to engage with sinners. We are no better than anyone else, we have all sinned and need Jesus\u2019 grace.> Part of honestly sharing our faith is acknowledging with others our own inadequacy without God, and the great news that Jesus wants to welcome us into the family\u00a0anyway.If we must keep rules and judge others to feel good/worthy about ourselves, we\u2019re preaching the wrong Gospel."

        "title": "The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Being in the World, Not of It",
        "body": "I was thinking about how, as Christians, we are citizens of Heaven, yet live in a fallen world, far from Heaven. There is a constant tension in our lives; the tension of living holy lives (through the Holy Spirit at work inside of us) in a very unholy world.The thought raised the question, how do we engage with people in a broken culture without being tainted by it?How does that practically work? Logic says if you play in the mud then you\u2019re sure to get muddy, right? A Q&A with John Piper about this issue got me thinking. It reminded of the passage in Acts where the Apostle Paul is speaking to the Greeks in the town centre, a place of discussion and debate. He contextualises the Gospel to Greek culture by identifying a familiar Greek concept, and then presents a new idea (the Gospel) inside of it.We read on from Acts 17:22\u2026> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \u201cPeople of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what I am going to proclaim to you.> \u201cThe God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. And He is not served by human hands, as if He needed anything. Rather, He himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.\u200a\u2014\u200a[Acts 17:22\u201325](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A22-25&version=NIV)In many ways\u00a0yesHEis, as a brand and as a product, is built around the idea that we can contextualise the Gospel in today\u2019s language, using the mediums of film, music and other storytelling techniques to introduce people to\u00a0Jesus.Effectively we find the \u2018unknown gods\u2019 in culture, and use them to present Christ to people. So, considering how taboo idol worship was in Jewish culture at that point in history (unlike parts of the Old Testament, the Jews were very zealous in Jesus\u2019 time), it fascinates me that Paul deemed it appropriate to use it to preface the Gospel. It doesn\u2019t mean as Christians we disregard Biblical standards, and need to use content that is profane or perverse to get our point across.> It tells us that we need to understand our culture to be effective in communicating Christ.However, in my experience, Christians can often withdraw from engaging with culture for fear of contamination, and I feel we miss the opportunity God has placed in front of us to shine His light into the darkness. It means we have more faith in the devil\u2019s ability to lead us astray than we do in God\u2019s ability to watch over His own (us), and preserve us.Let me illustrate: Let\u2019s say I was wearing a pair of night vision goggles. If I hold your hand and lead you through a dark room, even if you can\u2019t see me, you can still follow me because we\u2019re close\u200a\u2014\u200aand we don\u2019t walk into any walls. The only way you\u2019re going to get lost is if you let go of my hand.I think people\u2019s caution toward becoming involved in worldly culture (for the purpose of making disciples) is actually a reflection of the strength or weakness of their own relationship with God.Now hear me: I\u2019m not talking about engaging in sin. I\u2019m talking about what it looks like to be a disciple of Christ in spheres of influence in our society. You might make a TV series for a secular audience that illustrates Gospel truths and points people to Jesus. I\u2019m talking about being the person in your workplace who is a source of acceptance and love, and a shelter of grace from the harshness of workplace culture.> The objective is not to water down the Gospel to make it palliative, but introduce people to Christ through it in a way they can understand.If we run from engaging in culture, we run from the people in that culture. Yes, our goal is to ultimately introduce them to a new Christ-like culture, but we have to get over our fear of being associated with people of questionable reputation. Jesus never seemed bothered by it, and if we really are His disciples, then neither should we.So the question I leave you is:What is the culture of the people God has placed in your path, and where is the \u2018unknown god\u2019 in their life through which God wants to reveal Himself to them?Ask God to show you the parts of their culture that can be expounded upon, open their hearts to hear, and illustrate the Gospel to them in a way that they can understand."

        "title": "FAQ: Why Should I Share My Faith?",
        "body": "I am always surprised by the inquisitive nature of my nieces and nephews (all who are under 5). They ask questions about everything, especially the day to day things that we as adults have most likely resolved. Things like: \u201c_Why do we have to eat dinner_?\u201d, \u201c_why do I have a bath_?\u201d, \u201c_why is the sun so hot_\u201d or \u201c_why do I need to use the toilet_?\u201d \u2014 That\u2019s a personal favourite!It is amusing to watch the way my siblings respond to these ongoing questions. Often they throw back something like \u201c_because I said so_\u201d or \u201c_because it\u2019s disgusting to go to the loo on the lawn!_\u201d But what are they to know? They are simply young humans yearning to understand the why behind what we do.> There is a danger as Christians that we might fall into living a life of action without understanding the why behind that action. This is why is it so important to return to fundamentally important questions, such as \u2018Why should I share my\u00a0faith?\u2019Why should we share our faith? It is a very good question. A question that I think we should be continuously asking. It keeps us grounded to why we do what we do. So, why? Here are 3 reasons\u2026## 3 Reasons to Share Your\u00a0Faith1. We share because Jesus told us to. In the book of\u00a0[Matthew (28:19)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A19&version=NIV), Jesus himself commands his followers to \u201c_Go and make disciples of all nation_s\u201d. Nowhere is excluded, none is left out, the Gospel is for all and we are called to be the vehicles of that message. By the power of the Holy Spirit, we are equipped and qualified to share this message of hope and reconciliation. We are invited to be apart of the greatest love story ever told.2. We share because we love. There is a beautiful story in the book of\u00a0[John](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4&version=NIV) about a Samaritan woman and her encounter with Jesus at a drinking well. In this narrative, Jesus tells this woman that whoever is in a relationship with Him will never go thirsty again \u2014 they will drink living water and be filled with life. Do you ever look around and see the world thirsty for hope? Thirsty for meaning? Thirsty for purpose? Thirsty for love? And we hold the answer\u2026 Jesus. If you were lost in the desert and you found water, surely you wouldn\u2019t just keep it for yourself? Because we love, we share.3. We share because good news travels. I am sure we have all been a part of a message chain of great news. A new baby, an engagement or a new promotion. Our message of Jesus is a message of great news and good news travels.A good friend of mine many years ago was invited to church by his university roommate. At the time an atheist, my friend reluctantly went along (mainly for the free food) and was met not only by good food, nice people but powerfully by a God who wholeheartedly and unconditionally loves him. Over a decade later, my good friend now leads a city centre church in the UK, connecting with thousands of university students every week and seeing a city transformed by Jesus. How valuable was that invitation?> You see, when we are willing to share our faith we create new avenues for the Gospel to run like wildfire."

        "body": "There\u2019s this guy I know. His name is Dan. I think of him and I smile. He has this exuberance about him that is rare to find. He always seems to have a smile on his face and he embraces life and the everyday moments that it brings. Now, I know like anyone, Dan would have his down days, but even in the midst of downers Dan is up. He\u2019s real, he wears his heart on his sleeve, and he keeps smiling through it all.Dan has this way about him that causes you to go through what I would call \u2018the uncomfortable zone\u2019. There\u2019s this boldness about him that is contagious because it comes with this authenticity that is uniquely him \u2014 he doesn\u2019t try to be anyone else. He can do the most awkward things and get away with it, and in being naturally him, he draws out people in the room, allowing people to take a deep breath of fresh air. He has this ability to have a \u2018stagnant\u2019 room erupt into laughter and leave you talking about him for days.Now we aren\u2019t all Dan\u2019s, but it\u2019s important to remember;> God has gifted us each uniquely with talents and character to bring freshness and life into a room, rather than leaving people with a bad\u00a0smell.I\u2019m not suggesting that we should try to achieve getting everyone to like us, if everyone likes you you\u2019re probably not living to the standard God is asking of you.The question I would suggest you ask yourself is, are you socially aware of your environment and are you thriving in it?In displaying the fullness of what God has naturally given us, we cause people to take stock of their own lives and to start asking where our joy and life comes from. We raise a God standard and people take notice."

        "title": "Your Greatest Ability Is Your Availability",
        "body": "I remember it clearly like it was yesterday. I was stuck at a busy intersection behind a woman in a red station wagon. My car air conditioning had recently stopped working and the sun bore down like a blanket of fire. My mind could not fathom the thought process of the person in the vehicle before me. 2 minutes of earnest waiting seemed like 2 weeks. It was the opportune moment, why she couldn\u2019t turn the corner, I still don\u2019t know. Every muscle in my body was tense. My fingers were sore from tapping, my upper lip cramped and my patience thinned. Every millimetre of my voice box ached from holding frustrated words within. There had been so many breaks in traffic, yet she wouldn\u2019t move.Have you ever wondered why we get frustrated sitting in traffic behind slow-minded drivers, or deep down build rage when we miss the green and hit red at the traffic light? Is it the diminishing time in our day? The old adage that time is money and money makes the world go round, so to lose that time means you lose the money and your miscalculation at the lights makes the world stop spinning? Is it that we have become such a need and want \u2018right now\u2019 society that if we have to wait, it is not worth it? Is it that we rule our own lives so well that we treat ourselves like royalty and expect the same treatment from others?> _Your greatest ability is your availability._Often I don\u2019t think that is the case. I think we try and circumvent our frustration by blaming it on time or blaming it on need or ego. Think about this, if we were to remove time from the equation for a moment and destroy the inner wants of instant gratification, even take a step aside from what we need and look again at the busy intersection scenario. The only thing left standing is opportunity.As I sat behind the women at the intersection, all that sat before her and I was opportunity. Gap after gap in traffic went past but she refused to seize the moment. I was not upset because she was wasting my time. More so it was that deep down sense, that inner whirlwind that needed to see others successfully grasp their opportunities. It is built within us all. The need for more, the need to grow, change and advance in life. So to witness opportunity after opportunity fall breathlessly to the ground hurts even onlookers to a situation.> _Humanity is built on individuals, individuals within communities, communities who work together for a common good. So to see another individual in absence of opportunity hurts the greater community._We as the Christians are working together not only for the common good but also for the eternal good and the eternal good requires us to live a counter cultural life.When a person we are connected to flourishes, we too flourish. When your church flourishes, the greater church flourishes. So when those before us miss their opportunities we miss ours. The truth of the situation was, that I could not receive my opportunity to turn the corner until she accepted her opportunity.That\u2019s not to say we cannot live our lives and accomplish great things until those before us do. More so,\u00a0I believe the greatest things we accomplish with our lives are found when we help others take their opportunities. Accomplishments shouldn\u2019t be about who we are or what we have become, but rather what others become because of who we are.In the Bible, Jesus had the audacity to add extra commandments to scripture. He took what humanity knew to date as their guidance to life, the 10 commandments and lifted the bar. He said in:[John 13:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013:34-35)\u00a0\u2018_A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another_.\u2019 And then again in\u00a0[Mark 12:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A30&version=MSG):\u00a0_\u2018__Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength. The second most important command is this: Love your neighbour the same as you love yourself. These two commands are the most important.\u2019_In a world that is so self-focused, it may seem counter cultural to prescribe a dose of \u2018loving others\u2019, but it\u2019s funny, when we snap out of our selfish mode to love others with the same grace and love that Christ has for us, suddenly the predicaments we find ourselves in often become opportunities.> _Sometimes we must be counter cultural and do what we don\u2019t want to do to help others do what they were called to\u00a0do._What are the opportunities in others lives that we are ignoring in a pursuit of our own? Who could you help today? When we come with a heart to love and serve, it disarms and shocks people. Often our offers of service provide a platform for us to speak into people\u2019s lives.People spend their lives searching for identity and purpose, which they don\u2019t know are found in Christ. How great would it be to have a platform where people want to listen to what we say about Christ because they have first seen that we care.Your greatest ability is your availability. Who are you making yourself available for today?"

I\u2019ve got better at recognising my excuses and being aware that those moments were for a reason and that it was God prompting me to do something.> Every time I miss the opportunity, I ask God for forgiveness and ask Him for another\u00a0chance.Every time I hear myself saying \u201cIs that really you God?\u201d or having one of those moments of panic where I try and talk myself out it \u2014 I stop myself and just go!

I just know God wants me to talk to you about Him and I\u2019m a bit nervous \u2014 have you been asking God some questions lately?\u201d_When you put all the weight of the conversation back onto God, you can smile, relax, enjoy yourself and expect that when you open your mouth something understandable will come out.If you do find yourself a blubbering bumbling mess, just take a big breath, have a laugh, go red (if you\u2019re like me I go red in the face sometimes), \u2018calm the farm\u2019 and just carry on! \ud83d\ude1c"

        "body": "How can a \u2018life on mission\u2019 be defined? Simply, it is walking on a journey with Jesus and sharing that journey with others as you go. Being a living example of life with Jesus.Romans 12:1\u20132 (MSG) puts it like this:Take your everyday, ordinary life\u200a\u2014\u200ayour sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life\u200a\u2014\u200aand place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don\u2019t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.Committing to a life on mission is all about embracing what some would call the mundane daily grind, and seeing God in the every day moments of life. This means making the most of the opportunities in front of us, not waiting for the big \u2018moment to shine\u2019, but being that little nugget of hope to people. It\u2019s the little things that make a huge difference and become part of weaving the Gospel into the tapestry of peoples lives to introduce them to Jesus.A life on mission is an adventure. An adventure every Christian should embark on.Committing to a life on mission makes sharing your faith easy because sharing your faith becomes a way of life, not a thing you do.Here are a few things to help your life on mission:- Recognise the \u2018daily-grind\u2019 as daily opportunities- Listen to the Holy Spirit as you go- Put Bible reading and prayer as your life foundation- Chat with God daily about people and situations, asking Him questions and for direction.Stay \u2018switched on\u2019 to what He is saying in any moment at any time. When God speaks about doing something, talking to someone, acting a certain way, it\u2019s a good idea to obey even when you don\u2019t feel like it."

When we see our nation\u2019s leaders making laws that attempt to redefine the meaning of marriage, gender and family, it\u2019s normal to wonder what the heck is going on.As Christians, we know that Jesus is the solution to every problem in our world. But when we are confronted with these agendas at work in our culture, it begs the question; is the Gospel really making an impact?The answer is YES. There are endless testimonies that affirm this.Here are 3 places where churches and Gospel are having an impact on the world:1. The Church in China  China currently has the largest population in the world with 1.39 billion people. In the 1940\u2019s, communist leader Mao Zedong envisioned China as a secular society, and did everything imaginable to stamp out all religious expression, especially Christianity. 70 years on, Mao\u2019s plan is completely failing. Christianity has flourished under huge persecution from the Communist government._It is estimated that China will be the largest Christian nation in the world by 2030 topping over 250 million believers\u200a\u2014\u200a_[_China Aid_](http://www.chinaaid.org/2016/05/logos-post-persecution-in-china-rises.html)Persecution usually leads to exponential growth in the long run. Because the Gospel offers true hope in a hopeless world. We\u2019re also seeing this phenomenon play out in the Middle East, in possibly the most pronounced way in history. Take Iran as an example of what God is doing in many Muslim nations.2. The Church in Iran  The Iranian revolution of 1979 established a hardline Islamic regime that violently opposed Christianity. All missionaries were kicked out, evangelism was outlawed, Bibles in Persia were banned and soon became scarce, and many pastors were killed. And yet more Iranians have become Christians in the last 20 years than in the previous 13 centuries put together since Islam came to Iran. With 500 Christians from a Muslim background in 1979, today there are hundreds of thousands\u200a\u2014\u200asome say more than 1 million._Iran has the fastest-growing evangelical church in the world. The second-fastest growing church is in Afghanistan\u200a\u2014\u200aand Afghanis are being reached in part by Iranians, since their languages are similar.\u200a\u2014\u200a_[_Operation World_](http://www.operationworld.org/)3. The Church in Australia and New Zealand  On a less persecuted note, for such small nations, God is using the Aussie and Kiwi Church to do some pretty amazing things. Just look at how songs coming from local church movements like\u00a0[Hillsong](http://stfi.re/gdgoeng),\u00a0[Planetshakers](https://www.planetshakers.com/)\u00a0and\u00a0[C3](http://www.c3churchglobal.com/)\u00a0are being sung in churches globally and influencing culture through the creative and performing arts sectors. Each of those plus churches like\u00a0[Arise](https://www.arisechurch.com/)\u00a0and\u00a0[City Impact](http://cityimpactchurch.com/)\u00a0are also planting churches locally and globally and denominations like the Lutheran, Catholic, and Anglican have been on the forefront of community service initiatives for decades.Whether we look at what God is doing in our own backyard or abroad, we see Him at work in amazing ways, and they all send us a clear message. He\u2019s really serious about saving His creation\u200a\u2014\u200aus! It cannot be denied that God want\u2019s this trend to continue and increase.How do we respond to what God is doing Globally?\u00a0  Author and speaker\u00a0[Graham Cooke](http://stfi.re/zrxzbwv)\u00a0articulates well in saying that our \u201cyes\u201d to what God is saying and doing needs to be as big as His \u201cyes\u201d over us. We need to match God\u2019s enthusiasm for His purposes for our lives.Practically there are a few things we can do to cultivate this enthusiasm:1. Take courage from the reports of what God is doing.\u00a0Seriously, these nations are just a few examples of what God is doing in our lifetime. Globally, the Gospel is having a greater impact in the volume of individual lives today than at any other previous point in history.2. Have faith God will accomplish all He said He would do.\u00a0God has promised that the church will shine the brighter and brighter as time goes on. believe His promises.3. Pray that He will show us where we fit in His plan.\u00a0If you\u2019re uncertain about anything, just ask Him to make His plans clear for you clearer.4. Spend time reading the word and talking to God.\u00a0This will develop your ability to hear His voice. Cultivate that place of intimacy with Him.5. Obey with enthusiasm.\u00a0Say \u201cyes\u201d to what God is saying.The worst thing we can do right now is despair and give up. It is evident God is at work in the earth, so refused to adopt an outlook of gloom, and adopt an attitude of enthusiasm and hope.## God is the hope of the world and we have the honour to spread that\u00a0news."

        "body": "We live in a world full of restlessness, fear and instability. Yet, as Christians, Jesus offers us peace amidst it all.> \u201cI have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33> Peace is one of the greatest gifts God gave to\u00a0mankind.Yet, often we can feel far from peace. So how do we as Christians live from the place of peace that Jesus describes? Erwin McManus illustrates it well when he speaks about worship, and how genuine worship can create a shift of responsibility in our thinking.When we are feeling overwhelmed by life, feeling the stress, anxiety and the despair, McManus says it\u2019s because we have taken on responsibility for things that we do not have the power to carry.He explains that when we do this, it\u2019s like we pitch a horizontal roof over our life. When the rain falls, it gets heavy and our roof collapses. Yet, if we shift our roof to be more vertical, it causes the rain to pour off to the side and water all the fields around it, growing a harvest that eventually bares fruit.> Worshipping God teaches our soul to shift our roof vertically.This helps us to re-align our internal narrative to, \u201cThis is bigger than me. This is not mine to bare. I\u2019m going to give it to God.\u201d> Let\u2019s practice and refine our soul worship, so that when the rain comes, we can continue to be peacemakers who create fruit within the storm.Erwin McManus on Worship"

        "body": "The thrill of getting on a plane and heading off to a foreign land excites me now, but it never used to. To be honest there wasn\u2019t much in me that ever wanted to travel, until God changed me that was!So what happened? I\u2019m a story girl, perhaps deep down we all are. A story of suspense and drama makes for some good reading (or a good movie), but to actually be in the story sometimes can be a different matter. There\u2019s a tendency to want to jump to the end to see how it all ends. So here begins my story if you\u2019re ready for a ride?I used to miss my home, even after being away for a night. I don\u2019t really know what it was that triggered those thoughts in me, but I noticed them often. I\u2019d arrive at my destination and as soon as it came time to go to bed, all I wanted was to be back in my own place. I would talk to God about it and simply say, \u201ccan you help me, can you change me?\u201dI had made a commitment to follow Jesus, to give Him the driving seat and surrender myself to His direction. I had fallen in love with Him. But it wasn\u2019t like there was a big bang or flash of lights and\u200a\u2014\u200aboom\u200a\u2014\u200aI was changed. No, it was gradual. I was being wooed to something more.From the moment I had made that commitment, I started to see things differently, and the people around me differently as well.>_If God could change me, He could certainly change the people around me._I had been taken from darkness to light, and I wanted people around me to know that truth for themselves too. Not because I had it all together, far from it, I was a struggling mess at times\u200a\u2014\u200alike a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump from, (but I knew a jump from the ride would take me back into a much darker place).>_The problem is when we miss the process, we basically start the roller coaster journey again._So, I decided to pull the emergency stop, I couldn\u2019t waste any more time on a circular roller coaster ride. I had to get on a ride that actually had a destination. That meant making some significant changes to my lifestyle so I was 100% surrendered to Jesus. I needed people with me on that journey, so here\u2019s what I did;**I found a friend**The friend I picked was someone I decided to target. Sounds creepy I know, but her and I laugh at the process now. I honestly don\u2019t think she wanted to spend that much time with me as I poured my heart out to her looking for some accountability. If we were ever talking in the car, most of the time I could see her hand slowly move to the door handle, ready to escape and get out!But I saw a kindness in my friend, and whether she knew how to disciple me or not, I was going to be open and go along with the process. I was hearing from God, He was showing me what I needed to do, but I just needed a friend alongside me to cheer me on. In the end it was mutual and we both grew in our faith. We\u2019ve now ended up besties, where even though distance and years of not being around each other, the deep heart connection and friendship remains.**I told my story and built connections**I\u2019d had enough of trying to look like I had it all together, because the truth is, I was struggling. Not with everything; I had success in many areas, but to focus only on success is a lie.We\u2019ve all got weak points, we all have struggles, and we all respond to those struggles in different ways. So I brought everyone along the journey with me, (and by that I mean everyone). Because what did I have to hide? And what did I have to lose?>_If the book of my life was not open, how could people read it?_That means that a lot of people know my stories, all to varying degrees. Some people aren\u2019t interested in the whole book, and hey, that\u2019s ok! We can\u2019t connect with everyone on a deep level, but are our true titles showing?>_There\u2019s nothing worse than opening up a book with an exciting title and cover, only to find a whole lot of nothing inside\u2026_I wanted real, and people wanted real. So as I connected with real, all sorts of exciting things started happening. People started being real with me, opening up in ways they would never open up. How did I know that? They used to tell me! Life was getting exciting.**So what does all this have to do with missions?**The constant wooing of my heart, in love with Jesus, and wanting to spread the news of that, had caused a longing. My heart had started yearning for more more! I\u2019d find myself dreaming of going to foreign lands to reach more people with the good news\u200a\u2014\u200abut what was I thinking!? I couldn\u2019t even leave home for a night! Or could I?Without even realising what I had done, it suddenly dawned on me. During the renovation of my home, I was staying with a friend and literally living out of a suitcase for weeks\u200a\u2014\u200aand I hadn\u2019t even missed my home!>_God had changed my heart, he had removed my unfounded fear and had set me on fire with a passion to share Him._I would come alive as I heard reports of people coming to know Jesus. My mind and my heart started dreaming. I saw people, I saw nations, and I had started to cry for those nations.It didn\u2019t take a missions trip to spark my love for the nations, in fact it was the total opposite. In taking the small, sometimes very wobbly, but faithful day by day steps with Jesus, I had searched for more, I had shared my story, and people had come to know Jesus along the way.>_I had pushed forward expecting change, not waiting, but moving\u200a\u2014\u200alittle by little, and sharing my journey along the way!_It wasn\u2019t the longing for missions that changed me, it was God that expanded my heart for the nations as I fell in love with Him. Since then I\u2019ve travelled to many nations, I\u2019ve personally lead hundreds of people to Jesus; corporately with others that I\u2019ve gone together with, it\u2019s been thousands of people that have come to know Jesus personally. My heart beats for the nations to come to know Jesus.Missions trips are great, but don\u2019t wait for a missions trip! God wants to use you today, right now, right where you are!What has God put in front of you now? What is He wooing you into? Start sharing Him right where you are, and He will lead you into places you previously couldn\u2019t even dream of."

        "title": "Peace That Builds Up in A Crumbling World",
        "body": "Attaining peace sounds like a proposition that is near impossible to achieve. In today\u2019s world where access to each other is easier than ever, there is increasing division and fragmentation of society. _How do we make peace and live in peace with one another?_##### _Peace Comes and\u00a0Gives_As Christmas time approaches, we are reminded that peace _came _ on earth. What does this mean? Jesus is our peace. In John 14:27, Jesus assures his disciples with the peace only he gives saying,> \u00a0\u201cPeace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.\u201d\u00a0The coming of Jesus and giving of peace present us with an idea. Making peace and living in peace usually follow the _coming_ of someone who is willing to _give _ peace. Making peace means bringing peace where there is conflict in the same way that through Jesus Christ, God and man are reconciled.\u00a0> Do we know Jesus Christ, our source of peace? Are we willing to share Jesus Christ with others? We need to decide to be a presence and giver of Christ our\u00a0peace.\u00a0In the process, we need to give ourselves for others\u200a \u2014\u200abeing where the conflict is, meeting with offended parties and giving time and effort to the reconciliation work. On the other hand, our adding to the conflict through prideful and angry words and actions, and our silence and avoidance in the face of evil and conflict mean we are absent and are not able to share Christ our peace.##### _Peace Builds Up in a Crumbling World_Jesus assures his disciples of his peace in John 14:27 after he tells them that he will leave them one day. The Greek origin of \u201cpeace\u201d which Jesus spoke in John 14:27 (**_eir\u0113n\u0113_**) does not simply mean the absence or ceasing of conflict but the making of something or someone whole even in the middle of conflict.\u00a0> The peace of Jesus Christ makes us whole in times of great trouble. The peace of Jesus Christ builds us up when the world all around us and within us is crumbling.\u00a0For us who come and give the peace of Christ, we need to hold on to two assurances: that Jesus Christ our peace makes us whole and that Jesus Christ is the peace others need to make them whole too. It can be heartbreaking and sometimes frustrating to see what hatred and hurts our fellow human beings go through whether they are the culprit or the victim. _That is why we need to rest in the peace of Christ before we share his peace with others._I have been blessed with insight on this as I journey with my fianc\u00e9 these past months. I share these with her permission and love for you. A day after we got engaged May of this year, my dear fianc\u00e9 Maur was confined with what seemed to be case of a gastrointestinal illness which later turned out to be one of many terrible symptoms of a psychosomatic disorder. Since May, I have witnessed Maur\u2019s many troubles both from the outside and from within. I have seen how she had been beaten up and left exhausted by her illness. There were instances when we felt overwhelming fear and sadness and there were days we wondered how we could rightfully love each other. I thank God for his mercy and healing as Maur is now on the upward swing of her treatment towards complete healing. Please continue to pray for us that God\u2019s work in our lives will be accomplished. I thank God that the overwhelming peace of Christ enabled me to help comfort and encourage Maur through this trying season.I profess that if I did not have faith in Jesus Christ and who he is, anchored on God\u2019s word, I would not be able to _come _ and point her to Christ our peace. I had to learn lessons along the way which I wish to share with you.##### The simplest lesson is that of being\u00a0present.Surely, we are not Jesus Christ, but we can be the instruments of his reign in the lives of others. People with illness and other forms of struggles need our presence by their side, holding their hand and _empathizing_ with them, sometimes even more than trying to say something to them. This lesson humbled me as it exposed my restlessness because of my personality, my own expectations and at times prideful desire to make things happen.\u00a0> Holding on to the peace of Christ slowed down my pace, taught me to be silent and taught me patience.##### Another lesson is how the peace of Christ comes with his\u00a0love.\u00a0The love of Jesus Christ gives selflessly. _When we spend time being with people, when we give to them, we are not to expect anything in return._ This is a painful lesson. There will be times we just need to keep giving and giving and for me that meant rearranging my schedule to be with her more, encouraging her through hope-filled words and serving her in creative ways I thought I was not capable of doing.##### Third lesson is that giving the peace of Christ means seeking his truth in our\u00a0lives.The peace of Christ comes through _truth-filled advice._ Maur and I have been blessed to receive Christian counsel that encouraged us to seek clinical help. Not everyone is open to such measure, perhaps fearful of the stigma unfairly attached with sensitive illnesses. The combination of medical therapy and Christian counseling have wonderfully helped Maur.\u00a0> The peace of Christ brings his presence, love and truth that builds up the most troubled among\u00a0us.Maur and I have met new friends along the way, even those opening to us about their own struggles and conflicts these past months. There are many people we know who need the peace of Christ. My prayer for us is that we receive and live by Jesus Christ who is our lasting peace. And may the coming and giving of Jesus Christ in our lives lead us to come and share the peace of Christ with others.Written by Paolo Sanchez"

But, if you want nothing to stand in your way, you\u2019ve got to throw your entire self into that pursuit. It\u2019s an all encompassing task.>_A life on mission is also an all encompassing task._I don\u2019t say that to scare you, but more so to encourage you to consider what it takes to live on mission and example passionate and culturally relevant Christianity to those who don\u2019t know Jesus yet.Our calling as Christians to be \u2018Salt and Light\u2019 and bring out the God flavours and God colours in a tasteless and dark society is going to require our all.>_It may not be easy, but it most certainly will be worth it._What does it look like to put all of who you are into something? There\u2019s a short verse in the Bible (Luke 2:52) that I have found helpful:_\u201cJesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man\u201d_Interestingly this sentence is just about all that is said about Jesus in the years leading up to His public ministry. Still, it says quite a lot.**In preparing to live out His purpose, Jesus grew in four key areas:****Wisdom**: mentally/emotionally**Stature**: physically**Favour with God**: spiritually**Favour with man**: relationallyThese 4 areas of investment are worth considering when it comes to living out the and exampling the Christian life and following in the footsteps of Jesus.Wisdom is more than just mental acuity. It\u2019s really about insight and understanding. Insight into how the world works, how people operate, how situations unfold and in light of those insights, understanding the most appropriate way to live. Wisdom is mental and emotional intelligence applied to the study of life. It\u2019s being \u2018life smart\u2019.There is no area of life that has as much immediate impact on all other areas as when you invest in your physical health. When you spend time nourishing your body, your mind becomes sharp, your emotions stabilise, your spirit awakens, and your relationships improve. However, the opposite happens when you either neglect your physical body or when you punish it by working it too hard.The benefits of activities like prayer, Bible reading, worship and being still are documented and well-proven. These practices have a restorative effect on the soul and will open you up to connect on a deeper level with God.If people mattered to Jesus, they should matter to us. Relationships and friendships make the journey of life enjoyable. In fact, relationships are a big part of the Gospel, as Jesus pursues relationship with us. If you want the work of your hands to have a real and lasting impact, you\u2019ll need key relationships to keep you committed to that purpose.The famous quote _\u201cGo into the world and preach the Gospel, and if necessary use words\u201d_ is a quote I love and hate. I am a strong believer in speaking about your faith, but if there is a way to preach the Gospel without words, it would be to be an example in how to grow in wisdom, stature and favour with God and man."

I tried to pass her off as quickly as I could, _\u2018eek get rid of her quick\u2019_ was my immediate defence. When I got back to work, I made a special point of going around the office to tell numerous colleagues of my close encounter, and laughed about it.

Look past the response to understand _what_ it is they are actually saying and _why_ they are saying it.We once received a message from a guy who was swearing up a storm. But in the midst of the fiery language was the serious question, _\u201cWhy do priests abuse boys?\u201d_See, if we\u2019re too busy being offended by the surface level stuff, we may miss the key to the underlying heart cry. Listening out for the key helps determine where to take the conversation.We were able to write back to this guy to say we were so pleased to hear from him and that he had asked a great question. We were able to agree with him and say that abuse of any kind is not ok, and that it breaks God\u2019s heart as well as ours.The next step after identifying with the person is to ask questions about what they have said. This can lead to them opening up about why they have responded in the way they have. In our conversation with the guy who wrote to us, we simply asked, \u201cHas something like this happened to you?\u201d Sadly, the answer was \u2018yes\u2019.So can you see how these three simple conversation steerers can really open up a conversation that has been previously shut down?Perhaps you can think of a friend or family member right now that has been hostile towards you in the past?

I have overcome the world.\u201d_ John 16:33Peace is one of the greatest gifts God gave to\u00a0mankind.Yet, often we can feel far from peace. So how do we as Christians live from the place of peace that Jesus describes? Erwin McManus illustrates it well when he speaks about worship, and how genuine worship can create a shift of responsibility in our thinking.When we are feeling overwhelmed by life, feeling the stress, anxiety and the despair, McManus says it\u2019s because we have taken on responsibility for things that we do not have the power to carry.He explains that when we do this, it\u2019s like we pitch a horizontal roof over our life. When the rain falls, it gets heavy and our roof collapses. Yet, if we shift our roof to be more vertical, it causes the rain to pour off to the side and water all the fields around it, growing a harvest that eventually bares fruit.Worshipping God teaches our soul to shift our roof vertically.This helps us to re-align our internal narrative to, \u201cThis is bigger than me. This is not mine to bare. I\u2019m going to give it to God.\u201dLet\u2019s practice and refine our soul worship, so that when the rain comes, we can continue to be peacemakers who create fruit within the storm."

We even prayed and asked God for great opportunities to connect, and thought we\u2019d bake a fresh batch of cookies to take over and introduce ourselves.However when the sold sign popped up, the removalist truck did not. I was curious as to who this mysterious neighbour and his dog were with no furniture\u2026 just a man, his dog, and a white van.We were still waiting for the opportune moment to take over the cookies, but instead of that moment coming, the mysterious circumstances created distance between us and our new neighbour.A trip to the bathroom during the night showed that his lights were left on until morning, and my mind began to create scenarios that justified why it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to connect. My mother protection mode was strong.Why was he up at all hours of the night? What does he do with his white van? Why does his dog sound so aggressive when we walk by?Months went by. And instead of a connection with our new neighbour, I felt an unnerving conflict.Fast forward a few weeks later and I came home after a day at work. My husband had been looking after our 1 year old and had gone out for a walk. Seeing the neighbour on the way back from his walk, he introduced himself and got to talking.Long story short, my husband and our new neighbour found out they had a love for music in common, and we also discovered that he had been suffering from insomnia, which is why his lights were on at all hours of the night. We also learnt that, although he is an atheist, he is open to chatting about faith.*Boom. Conflict dismantled! I learnt a great lesson that day.*Who in your life have you unintentionally created conflict with? Maybe it\u2019s time to take steps to engage.

It is a mission that has been at play for thousands of years, and continues still today.Jesus is key to this mission. Through Him we are granted access to take part in it. His time on earth was significant. Why He came, what He did and how He did it, were all intentional moves by God inviting us into life in Him and exampling what that life on mission would look like.You would be familiar with the \u2018Great Commission\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200athe command of Jesus telling us to \u201cgo into all the world\u2026\u201d That is our call to take part in the mission.

A call to those who will go and serve in the far corners of the globe, but the mission of God is too important to leave to missionaries alone. It is not just a mission for others, it is a co-mission with God and us. It is a personal call to each of us.Our commission is to go in-to the world, not over-to the world. That means that our call is to live on mission and take the message of Jesus INTO workplaces, conversations, university campuses, families and cultures not just other countries.In the same way that Jesus became a human and entered the neighbourhood to fulfil God\u2019s mission, we are invited with Jesus in us, to enter our individual neighbourhoods and live out the mission of restoring humanity back to God.*\u2018Missio Dei\u2019 is simply living out the message of Jesus in community knowing that God is also at work in the community.*It is being aware of Gods mission while being on mission. Sometimes life on mission looks grand, and other days it looks grubby. Some days it is done with others and some days it is done alone, but it is never done without the Holy Spirit. He is centre to the strategy. In fact, it is our obedience to His prompting and guiding that ensures we are mission effective.Life on mission isn\u2019t a task, rather a lifestyle and a commitment we graciously accept when we accept Jesus. Accepting Jesus is accepting the mission.We are given both identity and purpose when we accept Jesus. We are both \u2018saved\u2019 and \u2018called\u2019 according to His purpose and mission. A mission which needs to be outworked not just in church, but in our homes, work places, neighbourhoods, schools, parks, street corners, grocery stores, phone calls and bus rides.If you have ever questioned what your purpose is, look to Jesus. He has already shown us! We are to join God in His great mission of restoring humanity to Him. The question is, are we being effective in our mission?All the authority of the universe has been given to me. Now go in my authority and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And teach them to faithfully follow all that I have commanded you.

Those differences, the gifts, the talents and the variety is something to be celebrated; and that\u2019s in a gathering of a few hundred people.Sadly there are times when the values shift in different church gatherings of people, and if we find they are moving fundamentality away from what God\u2019s word teaches us then it can be time to find a different church. Can I encourage you not to give up on meeting with others?Perhaps you aren\u2019t connected to a church and you need help finding one?

I was 10 years old waiting at an intersection with my parents, when an older gentleman stood on a milk crate and began to speak at us about sin.I specifically remember thinking \u201cOh, that is weird, please stop.\u201d Those around waiting with us didn\u2019t really pay any attention to him at all. I saw a young couple nudge each other, point and giggle but for the majority of the people within ears reach, he did not spark an ounce of curiosity with his words._Curiosity can be the catalyst for many people\u2019s faith journey so it is important to ensure we become good at sparking curiosity._People are more spiritual than we give them credit for, so naturally they begin to become ripe with intrigue when we live out our faith in a way that isn\u2019t condemning, but real and vulnerable.Surprisingly, there are stories of people coming to Christ through a message they heard from a man on a milk crate, yet there are many more stories of people coming to faith because they watched with intrigue, a friend or work mate live out their faith.Culture tells us \u2018we are all on a spiritual journey and that all journeys are equally valid.\u2019 While this is partly true (all are on a spiritual journey) as Christians we ought to be able to show the distinctiveness of Jesus and His incredible saving grace through the way we live.*Sharing Jesus is just as much about what we do as it is about what we say, and even more so about how we say it.*"

        "body": "Sharing faith is often avoided because people think it\u2019s scary. They associate it with the word \u2018evangelism\u2019 and that puts them off. In reality, it\u2019s actually fun, easy, engaging and interesting\u2026 if you want it to be.*Sharing your faith is simply following God\u2019s promptings.*Let me illustrate by sharing a recent story\u2026I was enjoying lunch with a friend in a cafe; we were getting up to leave, when a man walked through the front door and past our table. I felt an immediate \u2018prompting\u2019 from God \u201cI need you to talk to him\u201d. My friend went next door to do her shopping as I wandered around the adjoining gift shop, pondering how I could approach him, and asking God, \u201cWhat are you saying about him, what do you want me to say?\u201d_I\u2019ve learned to obey the promptings of God, He wants to use me to reach people._I\u2019ve said to God many times, \u201cHere I am, send me\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI can\u2019t say that and then not go! It\u2019s always interesting though, even after years of following through with God\u2019s promptings, there can still be a nervousness and there is always the practical question, how do I do this?The answer was simple, \u201cJust go up to him, you\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d I\u2019ve learned not to over-think and just take a step of faith and trust God will be there with me, and He always is. little tips like this are key seeing more fruit in my life._Let me just pause the story here for a minute_*Here are a few thoughts that are quite common to experience:*\u201cI may have not heard God right\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aYep, but I would rather step out than not\u201cHow\u2019s he going to respond?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThere\u2019s only one way to find out\u201cThis feels uncomfortable\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aOf course it will, but that is OK\u201cPerhaps he might get the wrong idea of a girl saying hi\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI can quickly put him right if he does, it\u2019s a public place and I walk in fear of the Lord\u201cI might get asked something I don\u2019t know the answer to\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThat\u2019s ok I don\u2019t need to have all the answers, and it\u2019s ok to say that. I can get back to him with an answer or refer him to someone who doesHere\u2019s one example of where Jesus sends the twelve disciples:\u201cDon\u2019t think you need a lot of extra equipment for this. You are the equipment. No special appeals for funds. Keep it simple and no luxury inns. Get a modest place and be content there until you leave. If you\u2019re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don\u2019t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMark 6:8\u201313Then they were on the road. They preached with joyful urgency that life can be radically different; right and left they sent the demons packing; they brought wellness to the sick, anointing their bodies, healing their spirits.So back to the story\u2026\u201cHello\u201d I said, (that\u2019s always a good start) \u201cCan I sit down?\u201d \u201cSure\u201d came the reply, and the conversation began. I simply explained myself, \u201cI was sitting here having lunch and I knew when you walked past that I needed to talk to you.\u201d \u201cOh\u201d, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s interesting\u201d. I continued, \u201cThis may seem a little strange to you, me coming up to you from out of the blue. I\u2019m a Christian and I felt God speak to me as you walked in the door that I needed to talk with you. I feel like God wants you to know something today. I\u2019m not really sure what that is yet, I just knew I had to come and say hi\u201d.Was I a little bit nervous? Yes! Sometimes I feel like I have to keep talking instead of having the chance of awkward silence, but I had now explained myself and it was his turn to respond.He was astounded, \u201cWhy me?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cReally?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cDo you do this often?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThe questions began and then bingo! He said something that gave me a key \u201cYou\u2019ve really messed up my plan\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t have God anywhere in my picture!\u201dHe had now said enough for me to come back to him with a question. \u201cWhy do you say I\u2019ve messed up your plan?\u201d, I asked. He went on to tell me he didn\u2019t feel like he had long to live and his health was not good. He explained again that God had never been in his thinking and now I was introducing something he hadn\u2019t thought of. As he talked the conversation unfolded, I identified with him and then I knew\u2026\u201cI know what it is that I\u2019m to tell you!\u201d, I started:\u201cGod doesn\u2019t want you to go into eternity without Him\u201d.He was fascinated and asking the same questions over again, saying things like \u201cwow, why me\u201d? I didn\u2019t spend too much longer talking to him as I had to go, but I did offer to pray for him and explained that I could do that at the table with my eyes open so it wouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable for him. He was very happy for me to pray, and as I did his eyes widened and he blurted out, \u201cI can feel a tingling down my spine\u201d! I finished the short prayer and explained, \u201cThat tingling was a touch from God and there\u2019s more where that comes from\u201d.Rather than leave the conversation at that, I asked if he might be interested in knowing more about Jesus. I\u2019d recommend that you try the same technique in this situation. He wasn\u2019t sure, he needed time to process, but he gave me his mobile number so I could text him a link to a video about Jesus. I sent him one of the videos I had found in the yesHEis app about Jesus. Within a day I had a text message back \u201cI would like to chat again (I think) when I\u2019m not so taken aback\u2026. it may not go anywhere I suspect but I\u2019m trying to grasp why me?\u201d I\u2019ve been able to continue the conversation with him, but I\u2019ll leave the rest of the story for another day.*Do you want to miss out on the joy of sharing the most amazing news, and bringing people another step closer to Jesus? I know I don\u2019t!Obeying the promptings may seem scary at times, but it\u2019s only by starting and practice that we grow.*"

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Pray?",
        "body": "Prayer is one of the most powerful things we can do. The Bible talks a lot about prayer, so it\u2019s important we know how to do it. Especially because it is such a core part of living effectively \u2018on mission\u2019.It\u2019s often overcomplicated, but at face value, prayer is simply just speaking with God.How did Jesus pray? When asked, Jesus taught His disciples to pray in a particular way. His prayer is known as \u2018The Lord\u2019s Prayer\u2019 and is the perfect place to start when wanting to know how to pray.\u201cOur Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.Your kingdom come, Your will be done,on earth as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread,and forgive us our debts,as we also have forgiven our debtors.And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.Matthew 6:9\u201313In this prayer, Jesus gives us a list of key things to do when we pray, let me break down each section\u2026*Our Father in Heaven, hallowed (Holy) be Your name:*This reminds us that God is our Father (who lives in Heaven), and we are His children (who live on earth). He loves us very much and is very approachable about any topic, so we need not pray in fear. It also reminds us that God is God and we are not. We right-size God in our minds by contemplating His awesomeness. This helps us remember that He is in control.*Your Kingdom come, Your will be done:*This reminds us that our purpose is to see God\u2019s Kingdom expand on the earth. This is essentially praying that people who don\u2019t know God would come to know Him. Doing this is extremely healthy, because it also keeps our eyes focused on others and allows God\u2019s love for people to grow in our heart. It also reminds us to surrender our will to Him, and ask God to lead us, rather than leading ourselves*Give us (today) our daily bread:*This reminds us to ask for what we need each day and be thankful for the tangible things in life. It can also mean spiritual revelation. If there is something about God or in the Bible that you don\u2019t understand, ask you to make the meaning clear to you.*Forgive us our debts (wrongs):*This reminds us to ask for forgiveness for our wrongs while also reminding us to forgive those who wrong us. We need to forgive others in order for God to forgive us, so forgive them before God in prayer.*Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:*This reminds us to ask God to strengthen us as we follow His will. Ask God to help you overcome temptation, break unhealthy life habits and choose His way for our lives. This is also a reminder to pray for God\u2019s protection from the plans of the devil to bring us harm._Relationship with God is actually an ongoing conversation God. As you practice throughout the day, expect to see God do amazing things._*Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for what you need, but notice how much emphasis God puts on outwardly directed prayer.*Prayer isn\u2019t just about our needs. Whether it is rightsizing God, listening for His voice to know His will, praying for others to know Him, or to forgive others. It\u2019s so much bigger than our own needs and desires.Praying for those who don\u2019t know God is so important.We all know people who haven\u2019t yet made a decision to follow Jesus. God wants us to pray for them and encourage them to follow Him, so that their lives can be blessed by friendship with Him.As you pray, you will notice God will increase the love you have for those who don\u2019t yet know Him. Act on this love, and share with them about what God is doing in your life. An opportunity to know Jesus is the best gift you can give to anyone.Salvation is the first step to this exciting journey, and so you can help others embark on this first step in the God journey by sharing about Jesus with them.It starts with prayer."

        "body": "People\u2019s objections to faith are often because of bad experiences with religious people. They feel judged on a good/bad scale. Jesus said: \u201c_Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\u201d_\u00a0Matthew 7:1\u20132Sadly, religious culture can be judgemental, and it can be hard to get out of because right and wrong is embedded in our thinking.\u00a0Judah Smith writes in his book - *Jesus Is* writes:_\u201cHere\u2019s how I assure myself I\u2019m doing good. I make up rules to fit my standard of living, the I judge you by them. If you follow my rules, you\u2019re a good person. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a bad person. If you have stricter rules than me, you\u2019re a prude who needs to lighten up.\u201d_We create our own delusion by creating our own rules to make ourselves feel better because we haven\u2019t been as bad as others. However, God tells us we have all have sinned; we have all fallen short of the mark. Judah admits that his way of thinking is wrong. Can we do the same? If we can, we realise there is no need to avoid sinners. In fact there is a need to go out of our way to engage with sinners. We are no better than anyone else, we have all sinned and need Jesus\u2019 grace._Part of honestly sharing our faith is acknowledging with others our own inadequacy without God, and the great news that Jesus wants to welcome us into the family\u00a0anyway._*If we must keep rules and judge others to feel good/worthy about ourselves, we\u2019re preaching the wrong Gospel.*"

        "body": "I was thinking about how, as Christian, we are citizens of Heaven, yet live in a fallen world, far from Heaven. There is a constant tension in our lives; the tension of living holy lives (through the Holy Spirit at work inside of us) in a very unholy world.*The thought raised the question, how do we engage with people in a broken culture without being tainted by it?*How does that practically work? Logic says if you play in the mud then you\u2019re sure to get muddy, right? A Q&A with John Piper about this issue got me thinking. It reminded of the passage in Acts where the Apostle Paul is speaking to the Greeks in the town centre, a place of discussion and debate. He contextualises the Gospel to Greek culture by identifying a familiar Greek concept, and then presents a new idea (the Gospel) inside of it.We read on from Acts 17:22\u2026Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \u201cPeople of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what I am going to proclaim to you.\u201cThe God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. And He is not served by human hands, as if He needed anything. Rather, He himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.\u200a\u2014\u200aActs 17:22\u201325In many ways yesHEis, as a brand and as a product, is built around the idea that we can contextualise the Gospel in today\u2019s language, using the mediums of film, music and other storytelling techniques to introduce people to Jesus.Effectively we find the \u2018unknown gods\u2019 in culture, and use them to present Christ to people. So, considering how taboo idol worship was in Jewish culture at that point in history (unlike parts of the Old Testament, the Jews were very zealous in Jesus\u2019 time), it fascinates me that Paul deemed it appropriate to use it to preface the Gospel. It doesn\u2019t mean as Christians we disregard Biblical standards and need to use content that is profane or perverse to get our point across._It tells us that we need to understand our culture to be effective in communicating Christ._However, in my experience, Christians can often withdraw from engaging with culture for fear of contamination, and I feel we miss the opportunity God has placed in front of us to shine His light into the darkness. It means we have more faith in the devil\u2019s ability to lead us astray than we do in God\u2019s ability to watch over His own (us), and preserve us.Let me illustrate: Let\u2019s say I was wearing a pair of night vision goggles. If I hold your hand and lead you through a dark room, even if you can\u2019t see me, you can still follow me because we\u2019re close\u200a\u2014\u200aand we don\u2019t walk into any walls. The only way you\u2019re going to get lost is if you let go of my hand.*I think people\u2019s caution toward becoming involved in worldly culture (for the purpose of making disciples) is actually a reflection of the strength or weakness of their own relationship with God.*Now hear me: I\u2019m not talking about engaging in sin. I\u2019m talking about what it looks like to be a disciple of Christ in spheres of influence in our society. You might make a TV series for a secular audience that illustrates Gospel truths and points people to Jesus. I\u2019m talking about being the person in your workplace who is a source of acceptance and love, and a shelter of grace from the harshness of workplace culture.The objective is not to water down the Gospel to make it palliative, but introduce people to Christ through it in a way they can understand.If we run from engaging in culture, we run from the people in that culture. Yes, our goal is to ultimately introduce them to a new Christ-like culture, but we have to get over our fear of being associated with people of questionable reputation. Jesus never seemed bothered by it, and if we really are His disciples, then neither should we.So the question I leave you is:*What is the culture of the people God has placed in your path, and where is the \u2018unknown god\u2019 in their life through which God wants to reveal Himself to them?*Ask God to show you the parts of their culture that can be expounded upon, open their hearts to hear, and illustrate the Gospel to them in a way that they can understand."

They ask questions about everything, especially the day to day things that we as adults have most likely resolved. Things like: _\u201cWhy do we have to eat dinner?\u201d, \u201cwhy do I have a bath?\u201d, \u201cwhy is the sun so hot\u201d or \u201cwhy do I need to use the toilet?\u201d_\u200a\u2014\u200aThat\u2019s a personal favourite!It is amusing to watch the way my siblings respond to these ongoing questions. Often they throw back something like _\u201cbecause I said so\u201d_ or _\u201cbecause it\u2019s disgusting to go to the loo on the lawn!\u201d_ But what are they to know? They are simply young humans yearning to understand the why behind what we do.*There is a danger as Christians that we might fall into living a life of action without understanding the why behind that action. This is why is it so important to return to fundamentally important questions, such as \u2018Why should I share my faith?\u2019*Why should we share our faith? It is a very good question. A question that I think we should be continuously asking. It keeps us grounded to why we do what we do. So, why? Here are 3 reasons\u2026*3 Reasons to Share Your Faith**1) We share because Jesus told us to.*In the book of Matthew (28:19), Jesus himself commands his followers to \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations\u201d. Nowhere is excluded, none is left out, the Gospel is for all and we are called to be the vehicles of that message. By the power of the Holy Spirit, we are equipped and qualified to share this message of hope and reconciliation. We are invited to be apart of the greatest love story ever told.*2) We share because we love.*There is a beautiful story in the book of John about a Samaritan woman and her encounter with Jesus at a drinking well. In this narrative, Jesus tells this woman that whoever is in a relationship with Him will never go thirsty again\u200a\u2014\u200athey will drink living water and be filled with life. Do you ever look around and see the world thirsty for hope? Thirsty for meaning? Thirsty for purpose? Thirsty for love? And we hold the answer\u2026 Jesus. If you were lost in the desert and you found water, surely you wouldn\u2019t just keep it for yourself? Because we love, we share.*3) We share because good news travels.*I am sure we have all been a part of a message chain of great news. A new baby, an engagement or a new promotion. Our message of Jesus is a message of great news and good news travels.A good friend of mine many years ago was invited to church by his university roommate. At the time an atheist, my friend reluctantly went along (mainly for the free food) and was met not only by good food, nice people but powerfully by a God who wholeheartedly and unconditionally loves him. Over a decade later, my good friend now leads a city centre church in the UK, connecting with thousands of university students every week and seeing a city transformed by Jesus. How valuable was that invitation?_You see, when we are willing to share our faith we create new avenues for the Gospel to run like wildfire._"

Now, I know like anyone, Dan would have his down days, but even in the midst of downers Dan is up.

        "body": "I remember it clearly like it was yesterday. I was stuck at a busy intersection behind a woman in a red station wagon. My car air conditioning had recently stopped working and the sun bore down like a blanket of fire. My mind could not fathom the thought process of the person in the vehicle before me. 2 minutes of earnest waiting seemed like 2 weeks. It was the opportune moment, why she couldn\u2019t turn the corner, I still don\u2019t know. Every muscle in my body was tense. My fingers were sore from tapping, my upper lip cramped and my patience thinned. Every millimetre of my voice box ached from holding frustrated words within. There had been so many breaks in traffic, yet she wouldn\u2019t move.Have you ever wondered why we get frustrated sitting in traffic behind slow-minded drivers, or deep down build rage when we miss the green and hit red at the traffic light? Is it the diminishing time in our day? The old adage that time is money and money makes the world go round, so to lose that time means you lose the money and your miscalculation at the lights makes the world stop spinning? Is it that we have become such a need and want \u2018right now\u2019 society that if we have to wait, it is not worth it? Is it that we rule our own lives so well that we treat ourselves like royalty and expect the same treatment from others?*Your greatest ability is your availability.*Often I don\u2019t think that is the case. I think we try and circumvent our frustration by blaming it on time or blaming it on need or ego. Think about this, if we were to remove time from the equation for a moment and destroy the inner wants of instant gratification, even take a step aside from what we need and look again at the busy intersection scenario. The only thing left standing is opportunity.As I sat behind the women at the intersection, all that sat before her and I was opportunity. Gap after gap in traffic went past but she refused to seize the moment. I was not upset because she was wasting my time. More so it was that deep down sense, that inner whirlwind that needed to see others successfully grasp their opportunities. It is built within us all. The need for more, the need to grow, change and advance in life. So to witness opportunity after opportunity fall breathlessly to the ground hurts even onlookers to a situation._Humanity is built on individuals, individuals within communities, communities who work together for a common good. So to see another individual in absence of opportunity hurts the greater community._We as the Christians are working together not only for the common good but also for the eternal good and the eternal good requires us to live a counter cultural life.When a person we are connected to flourishes, we too flourish. When your church flourishes, the greater church flourishes. So when those before us miss their opportunities we miss ours. The truth of the situation was, that I could not receive my opportunity to turn the corner until she accepted her opportunity.That\u2019s not to say we cannot live our lives and accomplish great things until those before us do. More so, *I believe the greatest things we accomplish with our lives are found when we help others take their opportunities*. Accomplishments shouldn\u2019t be about who we are or what have become, but rather what others become because of who we are.In the Bible, Jesus had the audacity to add extra commandments to scripture. He took what humanity knew to date as their guidance to life, the 10 commandments and lifted the bar. He said in:*John 13:34*\u2018A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u2019 And then again in *Mark 12:30*: \u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength. The second most important command is this: Love your neighbour the same as you love yourself. These two commands are the most important.\u2019In a world that is so self-focused, it may seem counter cultural to prescribe a dose of \u2018loving others\u2019, but it\u2019s funny, when we snap out of our selfish mode to love others with the same grace and love that Christ has for us, suddenly the predicaments we find ourselves in often become opportunities.Sometimes we must be counter cultural and do what we don\u2019t want to do to help others do what they were called to do.What are the opportunities in others lives that we are ignoring in a pursuit of our own? Who could you help today? When we come with a heart to love and serve, it disarms and shocks people. Often our offers of service provide a platform for us to speak into people\u2019s lives.People spend their lives searching for identity and purpose, which they don\u2019t know are found in Christ. How great would it be to have a platform where people want to listen to what we say about Christ because they have first seen that we care.*Your greatest ability is your availability. Who are you making yourself available for today?*"

Do you have tips for anyone who wants to, but is scared by what people may think of you?\u201dIt can be quite daunting at times to share your faith, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. As someone who shares their faith often, there are times I get scared too!_Fear is a natural emotion, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a normal behaviour._I have learnt to overcome any fear by saying a simple statement to myself: \u201cIt is the Creator of the Universe that sends me and He promises to be with me\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahow good is that! The God that created me also sends me, and then I go.*I have committed to always doing these 3 things\u2026*1) *Pray* and ask God for boldness2) *Listen* for the Holy Spirit prompts as I go about my day3) *Jump* at the opportunities that present themselvesI\u2019ve had to learn to jump. Let me explain, it\u2019s something that has come with experience, with time and with my own self awareness\u2026You know those times when you feel a little disappointing \u2018pang\u2019 in your heart because you just didn\u2019t have the courage to open your mouth and say something? Or the racing heart beat that after a while settles down to normal pace and you think to yourself \u2018phew\u2019, it was lucky that moment passed! I\u2019ve got better at recognising my excuses and being aware that those moments were for a reason and that it was God prompting me to do something._Every time I miss the opportunity, I ask God for forgiveness and ask Him for another chance._Every time I hear myself saying \u201cIs that really you God?\u201d or having one of those moments of panic where I try and talk myself out it\u200a\u2014\u200aI stop myself and just go!

Being a living example of life with Jesus.*Romans 12:1\u20132* puts it like this:_Take your everyday, ordinary life\u200a\u2014\u200ayour sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life\u200a\u2014\u200aand place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don\u2019t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking._Committing to a life on mission is all about embracing what some would call the mundane daily grind, and seeing God in the every day moments of life. This means making the most of the opportunities in front of us, not waiting for the big \u2018moment to shine\u2019, but being that little nugget of hope to people. It\u2019s the little things that make a huge difference and become part of weaving the Gospel into the tapestry of peoples lives to introduce them to Jesus._A life on mission is an adventure. An adventure every Christian should embark\u00a0on._Committing to a life on mission makes sharing your faith easy because sharing your faith becomes a way of life, not a thing you do.*Here are a few things to help your life on mission:*- Recognise the \u2018daily-grind\u2019 as daily opportunities- Listen to the Holy Spirit as you go- Put Bible reading and prayer as your life foundation- Chat with God daily about people and situations, asking Him questions and for direction.Stay \u2018switched on\u2019 to what He is saying in any moment at any time. When God speaks about doing something, talking to someone, acting a certain way, it\u2019s a good idea to obey even when you don\u2019t feel like it."

        "title": "FAQ: Is the Gospel Really Making a Difference?",
        "body": "There are many reasons to watch the news and many more not to. A bombardment of bad news can lead you to question if the Gospel is really making an impact in the world. When we see our nation\u2019s leaders making laws that attempt to redefine the meaning of marriage, gender and family, it\u2019s normal to wonder what the heck is going on.As Christians, we know that Jesus is the solution to every problem in our world. But when we are confronted with these agendas at work in our culture, it begs the question; is the Gospel really making an impact?The answer is YES. There are endless testimonies that affirm this.*Here are 3 places where churches and Gospel are having an impact on the world:**1. The Church in China*China currently has the largest population in the world with 1.39 billion people. In the 1940\u2019s, communist leader Mao Zedong envisioned China as a secular society, and did everything imaginable to stamp out all religious expression, especially Christianity. 70 years on, Mao\u2019s plan is completely failing. Christianity has flourished under huge persecution from the Communist government._It is estimated that China will be the largest Christian nation in the world by 2030 topping over 250 million believers\u200a\u2014\u200aChina Aid_Persecution usually leads to exponential growth in the long run. Because the Gospel offers true hope in a hopeless world. We\u2019re also seeing this phenomenon play out in the Middle East, in possibly the most pronounced way in history. Take Iran as an example of what God is doing in many Muslim nations.*2. The Church in Iran*The Iranian revolution of 1979 established a hardline Islamic regime that violently opposed Christianity. All missionaries were kicked out, evangelism was outlawed, Bibles in Persia were banned and soon became scarce, and many pastors were killed. And yet more Iranians have become Christians in the last 20 years than in the previous 13 centuries put together since Islam came to Iran. With 500 Christians from a Muslim background in 1979, today there are hundreds of thousands\u200a\u2014\u200asome say more than 1 million._Iran has the fastest-growing evangelical church in the world. The second-fastest growing church is in Afghanistan\u200a\u2014\u200aand Afghanis are being reached in part by Iranians, since their languages are similar.\u200a\u2014\u200aOperation World_*3. The Church in Australia and New Zealand*On a less persecuted note, for such small nations, God is using the Aussie and Kiwi Church to do some pretty amazing things. Just look at how songs coming from local church movements like Hillsong, Planetshakers and C3 are being sung in churches globally and influencing culture through the creative and performing arts sectors. Each of those plus churches like Arise and City Impact are also planting churches locally and globally and denominations like the Lutheran, Catholic, and Anglican have been on the forefront of community service initiatives for decades.Whether we look at what God is doing in our own backyard or abroad, we see Him at work in amazing ways, and they all send us a clear message. He\u2019s really serious about saving His creation\u200a\u2014\u200aus! It cannot be denied that God want\u2019s this trend to continue and increase.*How do we respond to what God is doing Globally?* Author and speaker Graham Cooke articulates well in saying that our \u201cyes\u201d to what God is saying and doing needs to be as big as His \u201cyes\u201d over us. We need to match God\u2019s enthusiasm for His purposes for our lives.Practically there are a few things we can do to cultivate this enthusiasm:*1. Take courage from the reports of what God is doing.* Seriously, these nations are just a few examples of what God is doing in our lifetime. Globally, the Gospel is having a greater impact in the volume of individual lives today than at any other previous point in history.*2. Have faith God will accomplish all He said He would do.* God has promised that the church will shine the brighter and brighter as time goes on. believe His promises.*3. Pray that He will show us where we fit in His plan.* If you\u2019re uncertain about anything, just ask Him to make His plans clear for you clearer.*4. Spend time reading the word and talking to God.* This will develop your ability to hear His voice. Cultivate that place of intimacy with Him.*5. Obey with enthusiasm.* Say \u201cyes\u201d to what God is saying.The worst thing we can do right now is despair and give up. It is evident God is at work in the earth, so refused to adopt an outlook of gloom, and adopt an attitude of enthusiasm and hope.*God is the hope of the world and we have the honour to spread that news.*"

        "title": "FAQ: What Do I Say To Someone Who Asks \u2018Why Does God Allow Evil?\u2019",
        "body": "The question of evil is possibly one of the most common barriers to people coming into a relationship with God. Questions like; \u201cHow can God let that happen?\u201d, \u201cHow can a good God allow evil?\u201d or, \u201cIf God cared wouldn\u2019t He stop evil from happening?\u201dI used to be one of those people that wanted to try and defend God. The more I got to know God, the more I realised He doesn\u2019t need me to defend Him.> That meant I didn\u2019t have to have all the\u00a0answers.I just had to get good at asking the right questions to get understanding and then help point people towards Jesus. It also meant that I had to be approachable and kind; it doesn\u2019t help anyone to get upset, or to get offended.What am I saying in all of this? How do you respond to someone asking a question about God allowing evil?*You respond with a question and then engage well in having a conversation. Here are some examples of what you could ask:**1. Why do you feel this way?*  This means taking time to understand, why they\u2019ve asked the question in the first place. As an example; If your mother had died, and you genuinely felt God was not only responsible for killing her but also happy about it, would you want to follow a God like that? I know I wouldn\u2019t! This may seem like an extreme example, but the reality is, there are actually many people that think this way.*2. What has happened?*  This helps to establish where the pain point is and goes a little deeper to find out more of the story. Listen carefully to the answer, as more often than not, you will find something that doesn\u2019t line up with God\u2019s truth.*3. What is your solution?*  Conversation is so important, and it\u2019s not about you having to give all the answers, so why not throw their question back and ask them what their solution is. It can be really helpful to see if they have considered this.Once you\u2019ve taken time to understand why the question was asked, you can then filter what you\u2019ve heard, and draw on God\u2019s truth for a response. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to have all the answers, and take care not to give responses that you don\u2019t know for yourself. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re still having questions about God\u2019s goodness, look at it as an opportunity for you to grow in your own faith, just be careful not to reflect your own doubts onto the person or the situation.God\u2019s love is never forced; if it was, it wouldn\u2019t be love, it would be control. That means we all have choice. When you make a decision to follow God He promises to guide and lead you\u200a\u2014\u200aHe wants you to succeed and do well, He has greats plans for every person. If people don\u2019t want to follow God\u2019s plans, He gives us choice and lets us walk away from those plans; those decisions can, and do, affect others. It\u2019s important you get to know God well, and get to know His nature and character so that instead of blaming God, you run to Him for answers. Be real, if it\u2019s something you struggle with also, this is a great time to discover truth together.Here are a few points to help you line up with God\u2019s truth:*God is good\u200a*\u2014\u200a_1 John 1:5; This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all._*God is the solution*\u200a\u2014\u200a_Romans 5:3\u20136; We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love. When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners._*God is faithful*\u200a\u2014\u200a_1 Corinthians 10:13; The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure._Sometimes it can be easy to want to run from questions or situations that you don\u2019t understand or that you find hard to answer. Can I encourage you not to run, but to use this as an opportunity to get to know God better and to help some people along the way."

What an opportunity, yet also, what a challenge!Generally speaking, over the years, we (as Christians) have shot ourselves in the foot by combining and paraphrasing Bible verses from\u00a0*Romans 12*\u00a0&\u00a0*John 17* to say \u201c_Be in the world but not of the world_\u201d which in turn has often been taken as \u201c_Be not in the world at all!_\u201d Unfortunately, this developed a culture which shunned any action or behaviour considered to be \u2018worldly\u2019 and in turn developed Christian subcultures where most of the time spent was in the company of other Christians.

Simply, the solution is to find yourself in places where you aren\u2019t only surrounded by Christians and make\u00a0friends.Proximity breeds passion. When you are close to people, you become passionate about them. When you are close to need, you become passionate about meeting the need.

Whether these associations are true or not is another matter, however, if the answer to terrorism is the Gospel, then hatred is not the way to bring resolution.As Christians we need to show love to all people, including those of other beliefs. We need to get to know them, ask them questions about their faith and share the truth of the Gospel with them.There are many stories of Muslims and people of other faiths coming to Jesus through Christians doing just this. One of our staff has spent much of his life working and living with those committed to the Islamic Faith. He says:It may sound strange but most terrorists are motivated by fear. Fear of death, fear of betrayal by their comrades or fear that their sacrifices, even the ultimate self-sacrifice of their life may not make them acceptable to God. Fear manifests itself in bizarre ways\u200a\u2014\u200athrough hatred or anger etc. Each of which are fear by another name.When considering the power of positive change through love rather than fear, the story of a former self-confessed terrorist, Solomon* comes to mind:\u201cSteeped in radical Islamic jihad from an early age, my overriding aim in life was to purge all non-Muslims and non-Islamic influences from Muslim nations to liberate them from these pagan influences. To that end I planned and conducted terror operations in the Middle East, Southeast and Central Asia.It was only when I began to be personally convicted of all the blood I had shed that I started to realise the awful truth about my selfish sacrifices. My practice of jihad and willingness to give my life and take the lives of others was a vain attempt, based on fear, at propitiating (paying for) my own salvation through selfish-sacrifice.Fortunately, I realised that this macabre form of religious altruism was cursing me and my jihadist colleagues and the lands we were supposed to be liberating by the blood we were spilling.\u201dUnfortunately, many of Solomon\u2019s jihadist colleagues in Daesh or Islamic State continue with these vain attempts to gain peace and paradise.Solomon is my friend. Every time we meet, Solomon hugs and kisses me. He says, \u201cI want you to know that I love you my brother. Once I feared and killed people like you, but now I am filled with the love of Christ for you and my fellow men.\u201d You cannot beat your enemy with bombs or money. Perfect love casts out fear.--As followers of Jesus let\u2019s be committed to 3 things\u20261. Prayer for the Gospel to spread like wildfire in countries where Islam is the most influential religion.2. Learning more about the religion of Islam and the politics of the Middle East.3. Not allowing our minds to fall into the trap of believing that every Muslim is a terrorist. Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to hate or fear an entire group of people.Jesus Christ changes lives! He once took what would be the equivalent of a \u201cterrorist\u201d (Paul, who was killing Christians) and turned him into one of the Gospel\u2019s all time greatest proclaimers.If He did it back then He can do it again!-- **Name and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of the individual."

In fact the opposite is often true, and we can distance the person from discussions about God and\u00a0faith._When a conversation turns into a debate, it sets up a \u2018them and us\u2019 pretence for the conversation, and puts people on the defensive. From that point on, everything you say requires a rebuttal. In a debate, most people prefer to be seen as right, rather than actually be right. This makes it hard for anything you say to cut through their defensiveness.Change tactics. Avoid the debate. Rather, share experiences with each other. Listen to their stories, and tell them of situations where God intervened in your life and did something amazing. Then ask if they would like to experience the same. You could even offer to pray for them. Even if they say no, you can leave the conversation having won the friendship rather than the argument.Winning an argument against a non-Christian can create tension in the friendship and close the door to future opportunities to share in a more positive way.

The journey of becoming more like Christ. Growing in love is central to that journey.To answer the question \u201cHow do we live like Jesus?\u201d we need to ask the question \u201cAre we loving like Jesus?\u201dLove is an interesting topic these days. It has been been used and confused in so many ways, that its true meaning and purpose is often unknown. While this is sad, it is a huge opportunity for Christians to use the actions of true love to reconcile a lost humanity to Jesus._To grow in our ability to reconcile people to Jesus, we must understand how to love like\u00a0Jesus._1 Corinthians 13:4\u20137 gives great description of how to love like Jesus:Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.> \u00a0It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.> \u00a0Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\u200a\u2014\u200a1 Corinthians 13:4\u20137That is an impressive list! No doubt some points on this list challenge the way you and I currently interact with others and even interact with God. Something worth noting and possibly working on if that is the case._Our ability to grow in love and live like Jesus is determined by our capacity to receive Love from Him and our willingness to worship\u00a0Him._We can only share from what we have. The list of actions of love from 1 Corinthians are all byproducts of an ongoing connection with Jesus. So, to grow in love and live like Jesus we must spend time with God and be in close relationship with Him. We can only give what we have received.Here are 3 practical and simple ways to intentionally posture our lives to receive from Christ to allow us to love like Christ\u2026*1. Read Scripture about His love.*\u00a0Find the passages that reveal God\u2019s heart towards you and the those yet to know Him.*2. Worship Him in love.*\u00a0Experience God\u2019s loving presence and express your love back to Him through worship.*3. Pray and rest in His love.*\u00a0Meditate and create daily rhythms in your life that revisit and explore God\u2019s tangible loving presence. This will cement you love for God and it will outflow to others.The devil will do everything to disconnect us from a strong relationship with God. He is fully aware of the power we have when we are in strong connection with Him. That is why we are so easily distracted when you begin to read the Bible or why things suddenly happen when we gave time to worship or pray.Let\u2019s commit to ensuring we are aware of where we stand with God, and continue to foster our connection to Him so we can live and love like Jesus, because The world needs us and the world needs Jesus."

        "body": "God loves to give out wisdom. He doesn\u2019t distribute it loosely though. He gives it to those who specifically ask for it. Two examples are Solomon and Paul in the Bible. Solomon desired wisdom so he could lead God\u2019s people. Paul asked for wisdom so he could boldly share the Gospel._When it comes to sharing our faith today, we need to be as wise as snakes yet as innocent as doves._Wisdom isn\u2019t normally an attribute you would associate with snakes, however they are very clever. They don\u2019t go picking fights, rather, quietly and calmly they depart from dangerous situations. They have very clear eyesight, a phenomenal sense of smell and can hear through vibrations. They sense trouble coming from a mile away.When it comes to sharing faith, each of those attributes, coupled with the gentle and meek qualities of a dove will ensure you can handle each situation. Easier said than done however, which is why we need to daily ask Jesus to grant us wisdom. Wisdom to know when to speak and when to listen. Wisdom to know how to answer. Wisdom to know when to calmly walk away from a fruitless conversation.James 1:5 _\u201cIf you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.\u201d_"

All around us there are neighbours, friends, colleagues, shop assistants, accountants, mechanics, doctors, builders, hairdressers, you name it, having a rough time. People often have no idea where to turn.By extending a simple invitation to conversation, you could be offering the answer that person is looking for. It\u2019s not to say that everyone is struggling, so listen to the Holy Spirit\u2019s prompts, be brave and reach out.Shwetha\u2019s story is an example of how a simple invitation, in this case through the chat feature of the yesHEis app, resulted in a broken heart being restored. My invitation opened the door to lead Shwetha in a prayer of commitment to follow Jesus, and just two weeks later she got baptised. She\u2019s written her story:_\u201cThere were the dark days of my life where all my doors were shut; my family and my love on whom I depended so much. I was devastated, lost and hopeless. I believed in God, but at that time I didn\u2019t know what to do, or who to contact.__As always, God hears everyone that comes to Him. Morag helped me realise that God is there for me. She encouraged me and boosted my faith in Jesus. God proved to me this was his plan and that He is near to those that are hurting. I felt God made Morag talk to me regarding faith, belief and to showed me path to get connected to Jesus. She guided me to join a church and such awesome people who helped me to get closer to God.__As the verse in Isaiah 55:9 says \u201cAs heavens are higher than earth, my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than yours\u201d. Yes, His way doing things is always right. His timings are perfect. Even though I knew about this church before, I never got chance to visit but then it happened on Lord\u2019s timing. I love you Jesus! Now I am baptised, I\u2019ve taken a lifetime decision to follow Jesus and know Him more everyday. He is the one I talk to and share everything, I thank Him for what He has given me, and I ask Him to guide me. He knows everything about me, I have surrendered myself to Him and I want everything to happen in Godly way in my life.__Thank you Jesus. You are everything to me. Your place is at the top before anything. Thank you yesHEis, Morag and Equippers Church for making me the person I am today.\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude00\u201d_*Is there someone the Holy Spirit is leading you to reach out to today?

        "title": "FAQ: What Do I Do When People Have Different Beliefs?",
        "body": "You want to share your faith, then, shock horror you come across someone who thinks differently to you! It can be confronting when people have different ideas and beliefs, especially when you find them to be totally against yours. Perhaps you\u2019ve come across people that are Christian\u2019s, and their beliefs don\u2019t line up with what you understand the Bible says. What do you do? Sometimes the differences are much more subtle, to the degree that it can be hard to pinpoint how two ideas, which seem so closely aligned, are missing the mark. Don\u2019t worry, this is not a time to panic, or to run._There\u2019s no set formula or process that can be applied to any of these situations._I\u2019ll qualify this a little further; you could apply a set formula or process, but then that\u2019s not being guided by the Holy Spirit\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s not a great idea. Doing things in your own strength, and not God\u2019s isn\u2019t cool.I\u2019m reminded of a story someone told me years ago, about people that are hired to notice or spot fake money and stop fraud. They never study fake money. Instead, they spend countless hours looking at the real thing rather than anything flawed or fake. It\u2019s in looking at the real thing, that they easily notice the fake. In being presented the fake money, they would then be able to point out exactly wasn\u2019t right, not because they looked at the flaws, but because they know the real thing.When we spend hours upon hours, day after day studying and looking at the real thing\u200a\u2014\u200athat being God and His word, we too, will easily notice the fake. That\u2019s the easy part. The challenge for us, is to not make it our mission to start pointing out all the frauds or fakes, but instead; to be so aligned to the truth that our lives and words point people to look to Jesus._We change the world, when our lives point people to experience Jesus for themselves._God made us all different, so different beliefs are ok, and God made us with the ability to choose\u200a\u2014\u200aso it would be super weird to think that people must think the same as you, right? We have to give people freedom to choose what they want to believe. This doesn\u2019t mean standing back, this means getting involved, to help point people to truth and give them opportunity to see the difference. So, practically how does this play out? Here are 3 possible ways\u2026*3 things to do when you encounter people with different beliefs\u2026**1) Don\u2019t freak out* \u200a\u2014\u200aYou might stumble over words, your heart might race, you may not know what to say. Take a breath. Relax. Joshua 1:9\u200a\u2014\u200a_This is my command\u200a\u2014\u200abe strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.\u201d_*2) Don\u2019t get on your high moral horse*\u200a\u2014\u200aThat means don\u2019t come across as behaving in a haughty, self-righteous, or superior manner. Something might be totally abhorrent, disgusting, evil, immoral and totally not ok. Remember there is no-one without sin.John 8:7\u200a\u2014\u200a_They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, \u201cAll right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!\u201d_*3) Take time to engage*\u200a\u2014\u200aTalk, listen, ask questions, be kind, loving, gentle, patient and have self-control. Seek answers to understand first and take time to engage in meaningful conversation and if you have opportunity, give reasons as to why you believe.1 Peter 3:15\u201316\u200a\u2014_\u200aInstead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ._The Holy Spirit is the one who brings correction, conviction, and changes hearts. That means, it takes all the pressure off you, and how you perform. All you have to do is listen to the Holy Spirit and obey.*Stay gentle, stay strong and point people to Jesus.*"

        "body": "*\u201cWhat do I do when people aren\u2019t interested in hearing about Jesus?\u201d* It\u2019s a great question! Sometimes the answer can lie within ourselves taking a stocktake of our actions and motives. This isn\u2019t a one time event. It\u2019s something we need to keep doing\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s about being aware of you, and how you love well. A good start is to ask yourself these questions\u2026- What\u2019s the experience of the person I want to see come to know Jesus?- Do I listen to understand or listen to respond? Have I listened enough to their story to get to a point of understanding and have I asked thoughtful questions that would help provoke them to think through deeper issues?- Am I showing them what it means to live an authentic life following Jesus, and am I living what I speak?- Does my friend need to say something to God for themselves to start the conversation with Him?Let me give you a practical example through a story of a recent experience and subsequent conversation that I had\u2026It\u2019s not unusual for me to take time out of my week to connect with new people. The day of this connection was a little different than most, in that it was ANZAC Day in Australia (similar to Memorial Day in the USA). A day to commemorate what the soldiers have done, laying down their lives for their country.I had been to visit Bob* the week prior and had been asked to come back on ANZAC Day, the 25th of April. Wow, I realised how special that was. He served in WWII, and I had the chance to hear the heart of a man sharing about the very thing you are commemorating.\u201cDid you enjoy the memorial service?\u201d I was asked by his wife, shortly after I sat down. \u201cEnjoy isn\u2019t a word I would use, I felt like I was at a funeral with a weird twist\u201d, I answered. I could tell Bob appreciated my sentiments and identification._This was an opportunity to open a very tender subject. This was not the time to brush this question aside but to dive in and discover our very vast, yet strangely very close differences._I had been impacted firstly by the crowds of people swarming to come, standing on the sand of a local beach, the morning was eery and somber and the sound of the waves coming in was louder by far than any chatter. I imagined the shores lined with soldiers, thousands more had died than the people currently standing there. The shores were not lined with weaponry but with people, families, friends, women, men and children. The waters were not crammed with warships and artillery and the skies were quiet. This beach was not a place wrought with distress, but one of peace and great hope for the future.I had thought of Bob many times throughout the service. My meeting with him the previous week, had revealed a man who lacked peace through the recurrence of the mass of memories of war that had been surfacing more and more as his age wore on. Hope had been lost.I did my best to articulate how I felt that morning. I then turned to Bob, and thanked him. I could feel the tears welling in my eyes as I thanked him for his service in the war; that through pain, destruction, grief and many tears he had been a catalyst to bringing hope for our nation. I handed him a box of tissues that I had come armed with. On one side of the box I had written a few words identifying the pain and grief, on another side, \u2018You Brought Freedom\u2019, and on another \u2018Thank You\u2019. On either end of the box, one end said his name, the other said \u2018love Morag\u2019.Bob is holding a lot inside; for one reason or another he has \u2018clamped\u2019 his story down. On the days he lets a little seep out, he says no-one wants to hear what he has to say. My response to him was _\u201cI do and I will remember this day for the rest of my life, thank you\u201d._ Bob went on to let more of his story seep out with me. There is hurt, pain, misunderstanding and all sorts whirling around in there.Bob prayed the other day for the first time in a long time. I say that because I don\u2019t remember if he had said he had never prayed, but he did tell me he hadn\u2019t let God in. He certainly wasn\u2019t in a place to talk to God when I arrived but as conversation progressed and as I allowed him to talk he said he was willing to try.He simply said \u201cJesus help me\u201d followed by \u201cGod if you are real, and it matters to me that I know you, can you please show me and open my eyes and my heart to you\u201d. I know God answers prayer, and I will continue to pray for that seed to be watered.Bob has opened the door, I\u2019ve heard the words from his mouth, I am a witness and although his words following may not reflect a soft heart, God is at work.Bob smiled when I left, he had been annoyed at times throughout the conversation, I had listened, talked, agreed in part, laughed with him and got to know him some more. The anger he feels, he expresses as frustration, _\u201cwhy has so much happened?\u201d, \u201cwhere has God been in all of this?\u201d_, \u201cwhy don\u2019t Christian\u2019s act on what they say they believe?\u201d the list goes on. He just needs time to tell his story, see God at work in his life and the lives of others around him, and hope will continue to creep in.Could you put this story of Bob into an example with one of your own friends or the people you want to share Jesus with?"

        "title": "3 Tips to Share Your Faith",
        "body": "Sometimes the thought of sharing your faith with someone can feel daunting and it\u2019s hard to know where to start. You\u2019re not alone! I\u2019ve been sharing my faith with people for years, yet I can still have those moments where I feel like I\u2019ve been given a shot of adrenaline, my heart races and my mind suddenly seems to go blank.There can be this urge to run, change the subject or retreat\u200a\u2014\u200abut if I listen to the still voice of the Holy Spirit inside of me, I do exactly the opposite, I lean in and step out. It\u2019s terrifying at times, but then so exhilarating! As Christians, it is a joy to speak life into the lives of those around us so they too may know the hope of Christ that is within us.*Here are 3 promises which have helped me share my faith:*1. God is for me (Romans 8:31)2. I have the life of Christ inside me (Galatians 2:20)3. The Holy Spirit will help me (John 14:26\u201327)When talking with friends, sometimes we can be overzealous in enthusiasm to share the truth we know, and our friends can sometimes feel like they are being talked at, rather than talked to, or listened to. Now, I don\u2019t want to curb your enthusiasm, so here are 3 practical tips to help.*1. The goal of sharing your faith is to win people, not arguments*There\u2019s a fantastic scripture in the Bible, 1 Peter 3:15\u201317\u200a\u2014_\u200aBut in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God\u2019s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil._It\u2019s important that we spend time in conversation to understand their journey, viewpoints and experiences. Don\u2019t be offended if your friend is really negative about God, offence breeds contention, and that\u2019s the last thing you need. In a situation like this, a good way to respond would be something like; \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that you feel that way, can you explain why?\u201d Try to read between the lines and listen to what is not being said. You will start to notice areas of pain, distrust, anger, sadness etc, keep them in mind as the conversation continues.God\u2019s loving kindness leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4). Ask God to help you be a carrier of that kindness. Kindness isn\u2019t about agreeing, but it\u2019s speaking truth in love. Be careful not to jump to your own conclusions about why your friends are responding in a particular manner, listen to the Holy Spirit and ask questions. Asking questions is a fabulous way to get understanding, and it helps keep the conversation open and friendly.*2. Stay consistent online and offline*Discipleship and evangelism go hand in hand. Our behaviours and our actions disciple people, the question is what sort of discipleship are we presenting? Take a look at Ephesians 5:15\u201320\u200a\u2014\u200a_Be very careful, then, how you live\u200a\u2014\u200anot as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity._Our lives are being watched both offline and online. The online space can be a great place to have conversation, but it\u2019s also a place where people tend to turn into someone or something else! Social media should not be a place to get on your personal \u2018soap box\u2019 and blast opinions at people. It is a place however where a mirage of thoughts, opinions and lives are shared for all to see.If you do happen to get \u2018blasted\u2019 by a friend because of a post you have shared or you feel to \u2018blast\u2019 someone back, \u2018stop\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200atake a breath and a moment to think and pray first.- Is there more to the story you need to ask first- How can I respond in a loving and kind way?\u2013 Give \u201cbite sized\u201d responses that people can digest- Consider, does this conversation need to happen in a private message or offline?*3. Use language which is easily understood*Your friends will understand you better if you use everyday language. Be intentional with your choice of words. Sometimes without thinking we start using words that would only be heard in church or read in the Bible. In conversation, avoid words like; atonement for your sin, the blood of the lamb, born again, sanctification, or hedge of protection. The list can go on! I had a funny discussion with some friends the other night about, what does a \u201ctravelling mercy\u201d mean?Whether your conversation is online or offline, always take time to consider how to respond to your friends. Trust that the Holy Spirit will guide you as you speak\u200a\u2014\u200aand of course you\u2019re praying for your friends already right?Being vulnerable as we share our lives with others helps them see we are not some super human, but, just like them, we also struggle. People connect with stories. As much as possible try to share through story telling. Can you relate the situation to a personal experience you\u2019ve had?"

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Hear From God?",
        "body": "I\u2019d love to look into a word I am sure you often hear: \u2018Revelation\u2019. Your Pastors, leaders or friends may speak about receiving a revelation from God. What is a revelation? Is it a sudden idea, a made up story or a secret message?People have revelations every day. Things like:_\u00a0\u201cIt was a revelation to me to learn that my headaches could be cured by drinking more water.\u201d_\u00a0But this is not the sort of revelation I want to explore. I want to look at the question \u2018How do I hear from God?\u2019 and look at the revelations that are important parts of our faith journey. The revelations that help us understand more about God and life.Without revelation, we are like the crowds who followed Jesus aimlessly, applauding the miracles and healing as mere spectators. However, with a revelation, we are like Peter, who knew exactly who Jesus was, and followed Him for that reason, and not just for what He did. Often as Christians, if we are not careful, we can find ourselves chasing the preacher, miming all the right Christian actions and looking for uplifting reactions from those around us rather than chasing God. _We can be easily consumed with public performance yet neglect private devotion when needing a revelation from\u00a0God._I remember as a Bible College student being consumed with public performance. I was studying full time, while also completing a full time unpaid internship. To survive financially I worked after hours as a freelance graphic designer. I was young and naive, yet up for adventure. It was about being given an opportunity to speak on stage and the praise received after performing well. I recount a day where I was rostered to emcee at a youth service, and at the last minute I was swapped with someone else. I hadn\u2019t slept in days, I had hardly eaten and I was spiritually weary. Something in that decision to take me off the roster really shook me. I remember sitting in a back room, crying out to God asking Him why. In this moment of weakness I realized I had been living out my faith in my own strength and that my identity was in my own ability. It took a small identity crisis to send me to rock bottom, yet it was in that moment that God revealed to me that He is the rock at the bottom. When my identity is found in Him then my strength can also come from Him. That moment of revelation really changed the way I began to live out my faith.The original meaning of the word \u2018revelation\u2019 comes from the late Latin word \u2018Revelare\u2019, a word used to describe that which was \u2018stripped down and laid bare.\u2019 If you look deeper into the word revelation you will notice it is made up of two parts. \u2018Reveal\u2019 and \u2018Ation\u2019. The definition for the verb\u00a0_\u2018reveal\u2019_\u00a0is to unveil and expose. It sounds similar to what we understand a revelation to be (an unveiling or exposure to a part of God), but why use the word \u2018revelation\u2019 and not just use the word \u2018reveal\u2019? It is the suffix (-ation) at the end of the word that makes the difference. The dictionary defines \u2018-ation\u2019 as the result or product of action. So to receive a revelation, it actually requires action on our behalf._Revelation requests that we, in private devotion, strip down our identity issues, let go of our insecurities and dispose of grudges and past hurts and lay bare before\u00a0Christ._Like He was, stripped down and laid bare before humanity, the greatest revelation. It is when we are situated like this that we position ourselves in a place to receive revelation\u200a\u2014\u200athe supernatural communication of truth.It took a small roster change to leave me in stripped down position before God. Yet in that moment, I was able to hear from God. These days, the times I hear from God are not circumstantial, they are intentional. They are sacred moments that I cherish because out of my private devotion I have chosen to bow before God and listen.The narrative of grace in the bible is that it is not about what we do for God, but more so what God has done for us. I am not saying that we only receive revelation through our action, it is always through the action of God, but more so that we can position ourselves in the best possible place to receive.*If it has been a while since you have heard from God, why not begin to position yourself in the best possible place to receive.*"

        "body": "Having moved around to new places and cities where I didn\u2019t know anyone, I have learned, through experience, that the best way to make new friends, is to be a friend. Everyone has a few basic social needs, whether they are a socialite or a wall flower, whether they are just out of school or about to retire. When you take an interest in people, you will arouse their interest.People want to be heard, feel needed loved and feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The difference between an acquaintance and a friend, is how many of these conditions you meet for the other person.The barista at the caf\u00e9 you see every day may feel you need her because she provides a service for you, but unless you listen to her dreams, goals and fears and show understanding and compassion towards her, she will only ever be an acquaintance.It is the same with social media. Have you ever wondered why Facebook affects so many relationships and why people who have never met in person, travel around the world to get married, simply because of an online friendship? It\u2019s because through unguarded and candid communication, people have managed to form solid emotional bonds with another.When we are communicating the love of Jesus to someone online, it is so important to display that love tangibly. We are communicating with lost people and we need to be a genuine friend who listens, loves and accepts.*They aren\u2019t a project; they are a person.*"

        "title": "6 Ways to Arouse Curiosity When Sharing Jesus",
        "body": "I vividly remember the first time I saw someone \u2018evangelising\u2019 on a street corner. I was 10 years old waiting at an intersection with my parents, when an older gentleman stood on a milk crate and began to speak at us about sin.I specifically remember thinking \u201cOh, that is weird, please stop.\u201d Those around waiting with us, didn\u2019t really pay any attention to him at all. I saw a young couple nudge each other, point and giggle but for the majority of the people within ears reach, he did not arouse an ounce of curiosity with his words.Evangelism by definition is the announcement, proclamation and/or preaching the gospel. It is a work of communication in which Christians make themselves a\u00a0_mouthpiece_\u00a0for God\u2019s message of grace and mercy to sinners. So, technically I guess it could be said that the older gentleman was evangelising, although I am unsure if it was a message of grace and mercy.Evangelism is a scary word.\u00a0As a concept and a commission, evangelism is great. However, as an action, the outworking of it over the years has sadly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many._For us, evangelism is sharing Jesus; and sharing Jesus\u00a0_is just as much about what we do as it is about what we say, and even more so about how we say\u00a0it._If you were to ask a non Christian, what they thought when they heard the term evangelical? They would probably reply something like: \u201cOh, those are the Christians that bait and switch. They\u2019re nice to your face, but they really just want to convert you.\u201d Sadly, there are many people who have been burnt by deceptive evangelism which didn\u2019t care for them as a person as much as it cared for their conversion. Taking interest in the lives and views of others, rather than just trying to \u2018push a message\u2019 always has greater return.*Here are 6 ways to arouse curiosity in when sharing Jesus:**1. Reclaim the Definition of Christian* To arouse curiosity and engage culture we need to reclaim the definition of \u2018Christian\u2019. We must help people understand that Christians are just \u2018broken people made whole through Jesus\u2019 (Romans 3:23],\u00a0[2 Corinthians 5:17). We are not an exclusive club of do-gooders or a special interest group. Rather, we are every day people who have come to terms with our brokenness and accepted the grace and mercy of God.*2. Model Jesus*  The greatest model of faith sharing is the model which Jesus exampled to us. When you read the bible, Jesus and other biblical figures used the power of curiosity. When expected to judge, Jesus wouldn\u2019t. (Check the story of the women caught in adultery in\u00a0[John 8:1\u201311] He would shock people by being in the unlikeliest of places; when others thought He should be attending to religious matters, He was having dinner with prostitute and thieves (Matthew 9:9\u201312). Rather than being on the fringe of community, Jesus was always at the heart of it. There is much to learn from that._Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more\u00a0easily._*3. Ask Questions* When Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in\u00a0Matthew 22:15\u201318\u00a0with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in\u00a0Mark 10:17\u201318 , or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. It is easy to be an armchair expert and make general statements when it comes to our faith, but too often general statements don\u2019t allow grace for a person\u2019s situation, nor do they create an environment conducive to conversation. Jesus was interested in a relationship, so He would ask questions which spoke to a person\u2019s heart. Sometimes, it is a question that gets the wheels turning in a person\u2019s head regarding what they believe to be true.*4. Lay the Groundwork*  When it comes to sharing your faith, rather than rushing to get a result (decision/conversion), it\u2019s good to lay the groundwork for people to experience discovery, joy and delight in Christ. Create an environment which arouses a curiosity towards your faith rather than an environment which possibly pushes people away from faith (like the man on the milk crate).Psychologists will explain how curiosity is powerful, while marketing departments will prove its power through our happiness to purchase goods. Curiosity is the innovation driving and emotion calming skill that comes naturally to us as kids. It creates an openness to unfamiliar experiences, laying the groundwork for greater opportunities to experience discovery, joy and delight. Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more easily.*5. Arouse Spiritual Curiosity*  People are more spiritual than we give them credit for, so naturally they begin to become ripe with intrigue when we live out our faith in a way that isn\u2019t condemning. Surprisingly, there are stories of people coming to Christ through a message they heard from a man on a milk crate, yet there are many more stories of people coming to faith because they watched a friend or work mate live out their faith._Our aim isn\u2019t to become experts in arousing curiosity, our aim is to become more like\u00a0Christ._Culture tells us \u2018we are all on a spiritual journey and that all journeys are equally valid.\u2019 While this is partly true (all are on a spiritual journey) as Christians we ought be able to show the distinctiveness of Jesus and His incredible saving grace through the way we live.\u00a0Living in a way that arouses curiosity in others does not ignore the fact that people are dead in sin, it just gives us credibility when it comes to the moment of helping people realise that.*6. Apologise*  It is amazing how far an apology can take you. There have been many unusual things said and done in the name of evangelism and often non Christians can find those a hurdle to accepting Christ. When arousing curiosity, be apologetic for the evangelistic faux pas which have given Jesus a bad name, while also being unapologetic about the truth of the gospel to transform any life and any culture.I am sure there are many other ways to arouse curiosity, but why not start with these. The aim isn\u2019t to become an expert in arousing curiosity, the aim is to become more like Christ._If becoming like Christ is our \u2018what\u2019, then there is great importance to \u2018how\u2019 we share our\u00a0faith._Remember the words of Jesus in\u00a0Matthew 10:16 when He said: \u201cStay alert. This is hazardous work I\u2019m assigning you. You\u2019re going to be like sheep running through a wolf pack, so don\u2019t call attention to yourselves. Be as cunning as a snake, inoffensive as a dove.\u201d"

        "body": "We all face seasons where the busyness of life is so intense that finding time to breath is tricky, let alone finding time to share Jesus. So, the question \u201cHow do I share Jesus in the midst of stress?\u201d is certainly valid!Being a Christian doesn\u2019t make you perfect, or remove you from challenge and stress, rather, your faith gives you an anchor in your stress, and your imperfections are cracks which God can shine hope through. So, it is important to remember that even amidst the busyness, you are a beacon of hope in your workplace, university, or home. Because, sharing Jesus is not only what you say, but how you act, hold yourself and persevere in the hard times.Knowing that shifts the question from \u201cHow do I share Jesus in the midst of stress?\u201d to \u201cWho is my anchor in the midst of stress\u00a0?\u201d Is it yourself, or is it God? If it is God, you\u2019ve picked a winner!_When you know WHO your anchor is, you know HOW to handle stressful situations._Jesus is a great example of this. Throughout the Bible, He always made time to connect and centre His spirit in line with God\u2019s. Even in times, we would consider a great stress. A.K.A, the days leading up to the cross! He set aside time to pray and spend with God. He was so connected to the source of life that no matter the chaos and stresses around Him, He had clarity of mind and purpose, which allowed Him to prioritise people. In a crowd of thousands, He was able to identify the lady who touched his cloak in faith and pause, heal and encourage her.If you are like me, you desire to see change in the world, but feel that in the season you are currently in that seems like an impossible task. The truth is, we all go through different seasons, and each come with their own pressures and challenges, yet none of them are void of the need to press into Jesus._When you are passionate about changing your world, you first need to be consumed with the Holy Spirit changing you. When there is change in your inner life, there will be change in the world around\u00a0you._ It\u2019s imperative that you are willing to let the Holy Spirit change you from the inside out. If you are not willing to let that change happen in you, how can you expect it to happen in the world around you? It\u2019s a win, win effect. When people see Jesus outworking in you, it\u2019s a beacon of hope which sparks intrigue and becomes the greatest advertisement._When Jesus transforms you; it changes the way you speak, the way you see the world, the way you interact with the world. No one can argue with a changed life. Self-help cannot do what Jesus can\u00a0do._Let\u2019s be the people who choose to dig into Jesus. People who create change, by ourselves being transformed by Jesus from the inside out. What would it look like if all of us \u2014 families, friends, churches lived from a place of being transformed from the inside out?"

I have overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33**>_Peace is one of the greatest gifts God gave to mankind._Yet, often we can feel far from peace. So how do we as Christians live from the place of peace that Jesus describes? Erwin McManus illustrates it well when he speaks about worship, and how genuine worship can create a shift of responsibility in our thinking.When we are feeling overwhelmed by life, feeling the stress, anxiety and the despair, McManus says it\u2019s because we have taken on responsibility for things that we do not have the power to carry.He explains that when we do this, it\u2019s like we pitch a horizontal roof over our life. When the rain falls, it gets heavy and our roof collapses. Yet, if we shift our roof to be more vertical, it causes the rain to pour off to the side and water all the fields around it, growing a harvest that eventually bares fruit.>_Worshipping God teaches our soul to shift our roof vertically._This helps us to re-align our internal narrative to, \u201cThis is bigger than me. This is not mine to bare. I\u2019m going to give it to God.\u201dLet\u2019s practice and refine our soul worship, so that when the rain comes, we can continue to be peacemakers who create fruit within the storm."

I\u2019m ashamed to admit this was a lesson I learned recently, and I was the one creating the conflict\u2026My husband and I bought our first house a year ago, so when the house next door to us went up for sale, we were excited about who our new neighbour could be. We even prayed and asked God for great opportunities to connect, and thought we\u2019d bake a fresh batch of cookies to take over and introduce ourselves.However when the sold sign popped up, the removalist truck did not. I was curious as to who this mysterious neighbour and his dog were with no furniture\u2026 just a man, his dog, and a white van.We were still waiting for the opportune moment to take over the cookies, but instead of that moment coming, the mysterious circumstances created distance between us and our new neighbour.A trip to the bathroom during the night showed that his lights were left on until morning, and my mind began to create scenarios that justified why it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to connect. My mother protection mode was strong.Why was he up at all hours of the night? What does he do with his white van? Why does his dog sound so aggressive when we walk by?Months went by. And instead of a connection with our new neighbour, I felt an unnerving conflict.Fast forward a few weeks later and I came home after a day at work. My husband had been looking after our 1 year old and had gone out for a walk. Seeing the neighbour on the way back from his walk, he introduced himself and got to talking.Long story short, my husband and our new neighbour found out they had a love for music in common, and we also discovered that he had been suffering from insomnia, which is why his lights were on at all hours of the night. We also learnt that, although he is an atheist, he is open to chatting about faith.Boom. Conflict dismantled! I learnt a great lesson that day.Who in your life have you unintentionally created conflict with? Maybe it\u2019s time to take steps to engage.

Those habits were:**Habit 1: **Daily time with God  **Habit 2: **Regular time with other Christians\u00a0  **Habit 3:** Giving of yourself> The foundational habit for all spiritual maturity is having a daily time with God. Nobody can do this for you, it is a habit you must cultivate for yourself.**A huge part of daily time with God is time spent reading the Bible. With that in mind, let\u2019s look a how to read the Bible and apply it to your life.**A core conviction of effective faith sharing Christians is that the Bible matters and that a life on mission is one solidified in the Bible.To help assimilate what you read in the Bible, it helps to have a journal handy to write out what you\u2019re learning. There are many effective way to read and journal the Bible, one particularly helpful method uses the acronym S.O.A.P.Choose a verse or verses from your daily reading and write them out in full.Note down all the observations you can make about these verses of scripture. Ask and an answer questions like:- Who is writing/speaking?- Why are they writing/speaking?- Who are they speaking to?- What\u2019s the big idea that they\u2019re communicating?- How are people responding?- Are there any other parts of scripture that say a similar thing?You might also note down things you don\u2019t understand; questions you want to ask somebody about.Write down how you can apply what you\u2019ve read in your personal life. Ask and an answer questions like:- Does what I\u2019ve read change the way I perceive God, or others, or myself?- Are there attitudes I need to adjust; something I need to do, or stop doing?- Are there people I need to forgive or relationships I need to approach differently?- Is there a promise from God that I need to believe and put confidence in?Write down what you need to apply.It\u2019s impossible to live the Christian life except that God helps us. Take a moment to ask God to help you apply what you have read.If you are new to prayer, or prayer is a space you want t get better at, Here is another blog we have written called: [How Do I Pray?](https://thejourney.yesheis.com/how-do-i-pray-cb8627dce6f4)> Having daily time with God can be really simple, as simple reading your Bible and\u00a0praying.These two habits are not really separate from one another; they work best when they flow together. As you read the Bible, pray and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you. Then as you read the truths in the Bible, pray and ask the Holy Spirit to teach you how to apply the truth in your life.**As you live on mission why not use this model of Bible reading to disciple others in the early steps of their new found relationship with Jesus!**"

It starts in September and builds up as the month\u2019s pass by; Christmas songs slide into the airwaves, carollers begin to frequent the streets, and faraway loved ones begin to come home. As the nights get longer ever so slightly, the streets get brighter with all the festive lights.> Why is it that we seem to celebrate the yuletide season by putting on a display of light? It\u2019s because this is the time of the year we remember that true light has come into our world, light in the form of a baby born in Bethlehem.The Bible often describes the world as a dark place. With all the pain we cause one another, suffering inflicted by disease, and hardship experienced in everyday life, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine our world as one veiled in darkness.> But the hope we have in the gospel\u200a\u2014\u200athe hope we are reminded of in this month of December\u200a\u2014\u200ais the that Christ has come to shed light into the darkest parts of our lives and has given us new life in\u00a0Him.The King of kings, the Prince of Peace, has come to give a life of love and peace to His beloved people. There is no darkness too powerful to overcome the light that Jesus brings into the life of those who love and follow Him. **It is because of this light that we can find hope in desperate times, strength when the burdens get heavier, and mercy when we need it most.**For those who are in Christ, there is a reason to celebrate. A reason to put your lights on display and bask in its brightness. There might still be some dimness every now and then, a few real struggles to face. **But despite these trials, we can still rejoice. **This Christmas we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, the light of the world, because through Him we were born again."

It is a mission that has been at play for thousands of years, and continues still today.**Jesus is key to this mission. **Through Him we are granted access to take part in it. His time on earth was significant. Why He came, what He did and how He did it, were all intentional moves by God inviting us into life in Him and exampling what that life on mission would look like.You would be familiar with the \u2018Great Commission\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200athe command of Jesus telling us to \u201cgo into all the world\u2026\u201d That is our call to take part in the mission.

It is a personal call to each of us.Our commission is to go in-to the world, not over-to the world. That means that our call is to live on mission and take the message of Jesus INTO workplaces, conversations, university campuses, families and cultures not just other countries.In the same way that Jesus became a human and entered the neighborhood to fulfil God\u2019s mission, we are invited with Jesus in us, to enter our individual neighborhoods and live out the mission of restoring humanity back to God.> \u2018Missio Dei\u2019 is simply living out the message of Jesus in community knowing that God is also at work in the community.It is being aware of Gods mission while being on mission. Sometimes life on mission looks grand, and other days it looks grubby. Some days it is done with others and some days it is done alone, but it is never done without the Holy Spirit. He is central to the strategy. In fact,** it is our obedience to His prompting and guiding that ensures we are mission effective.**> Life on mission isn\u2019t a task, rather a lifestyle and a commitment we graciously accept when we accept Jesus. Accepting Jesus is accepting the\u00a0mission.We are given both identity and purpose when we accept Jesus. We are both \u2018saved\u2019 and \u2018called\u2019 according to His purpose and mission. A mission which needs to be outworked not just in church, but in our homes, work places, neighborhoods, schools, parks, street corners, grocery stores, phone calls and bus rides.If you have ever questioned what your purpose is, look to Jesus. He has already shown us! We are to join God in His great mission of restoring humanity to Him. The question is, are we being effective in our mission?_And Jesus came up to them and spoke to them, saying, \u201cAll authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u200a\u2014\u200a_**Matthew 28:18\u201320 (NASB)**"

Some people promise to start going to the gym, others strive to read more books than they did the year before. We\u2019re not exempt from this desire to pursue a new and better life.

New habits might make their mark on our character and make us kinder, smarter, healthier, or happier. But God tells us that the opposite is true. The reason why we\u2019re able to leave behind bad habits and old hang-ups isn\u2019t because of a new routine or a yoga class, and the key to being a better you isn\u2019t in a self-help book.> \u00a0God\u2019s way of making His people holy, kind, wise, and pure is by making them new altogether.\u00a0And from that newness of life, **He gives them new desires and enables them to do new things for His glory and their good.** If you are in Christ, you don\u2019t have to come up with new hobbies or habits to have a new lease on life. You have already been made knew through the work of Christ. That means that we don\u2019t have to be a slave to our former selves, but we can walk in a new way of life.Being a Christian isn\u2019t about working for God\u2019s favour by being more religious. **It\u2019s about God\u2019s favour working in our lives by making us love Him more and pursue Him more intentionally.** This New Year, we hope that God\u2019s renewing love enables you to walk closer and closer to Him as the months unfold."

It\u2019s always interesting though, even after years of following through with God\u2019s promptings, there can still be a nervousness and there is always the practical question, how do I do this?The answer was simple, \u201cJust go up to him, you\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d I\u2019ve learned not to over-think and just take a step of faith and trust God will be there with me, and He always is. little tips like this are key seeing more fruit in my life._Let me just pause the story here for a minute_**Here are a few thoughts that are quite common to experience:**\u201cI may have not heard God right\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aYep, but I would rather step out than not\u201cHow\u2019s he going to respond?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThere\u2019s only one way to find out\u201cThis feels uncomfortable\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aOf course it will, but that is OK\u201cPerhaps he might get the wrong idea of a girl saying hi\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aI can quickly put him right if he does, it\u2019s a public place and I walk in fear of the Lord\u201cI might get asked something I don\u2019t know the answer to\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThat\u2019s ok I don\u2019t need to have all the answers, and it\u2019s ok to say that. I can get back to him with an answer or refer him to someone who doesHere\u2019s one example of where Jesus sends the twelve disciples:\u201cDon\u2019t think you need a lot of extra equipment for this. You are the equipment. No special appeals for funds. Keep it simple and no luxury inns. Get a modest place and be content there until you leave. If you\u2019re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don\u2019t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMark 6:8\u201313Then they were on the road. They preached with joyful urgency that life can be radically different; right and left they sent the demons packing; they brought wellness to the sick, anointing their bodies, healing their spirits.So back to the story\u2026\u201cHello\u201d I said, (that\u2019s always a good start) \u201cCan I sit down?\u201d \u201cSure\u201d came the reply, and the conversation began. I simply explained myself, \u201cI was sitting here having lunch and I knew when you walked past that I needed to talk to you.\u201d \u201cOh\u201d, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s interesting\u201d. I continued, \u201cThis may seem a little strange to you, me coming up to you from out of the blue. I\u2019m a Christian and I felt God speak to me as you walked in the door that I needed to talk with you. I feel like God wants you to know something today. I\u2019m not really sure what that is yet, I just knew I had to come and say hi\u201d.Was I a little bit nervous? Yes! Sometimes I feel like I have to keep talking instead of having the chance of awkward silence, but I had now explained myself and it was his turn to respond.He was astounded, \u201cWhy me?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cReally?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cDo you do this often?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThe questions began and then bingo! He said something that gave me a key \u201cYou\u2019ve really messed up my plan\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t have God anywhere in my picture!\u201dHe had now said enough for me to come back to him with a question. \u201cWhy do you say I\u2019ve messed up your plan?\u201d, I asked. He went on to tell me he didn\u2019t feel like he had long to live and his health was not good. He explained again that God had never been in his thinking and now I was introducing something he hadn\u2019t thought of. As he talked the conversation unfolded, I identified with him and then I knew\u2026\u201cI know what it is that I\u2019m to tell you!\u201d, I started:>-\u201cGod doesn\u2019t want you to go into eternity without Him\u201d._He was fascinated and asking the same questions over again, saying things like \u201cwow, why me\u201d? I didn\u2019t spend too much longer talking to him as I had to go, but I did offer to pray for him and explained that I could do that at the table with my eyes open so it wouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable for him. He was very happy for me to pray, and as I did his eyes widened and he blurted out, \u201cI can feel a tingling down my spine\u201d! I finished the short prayer and explained, \u201cThat tingling was a touch from God and there\u2019s more where that comes from\u201d.Rather than leave the conversation at that, I asked if he might be interested in knowing more about Jesus. I\u2019d recommend that you try the same technique in this situation. He wasn\u2019t sure, he needed time to process, but he gave me his mobile number so I could text him a link to a video about Jesus. I sent him one of the videos I had found in the yesHEis app about Jesus. Within a day I had a text message back \u201cI would like to chat again (I think) when I\u2019m not so taken aback\u2026. it may not go anywhere I suspect but I\u2019m trying to grasp why me?\u201d I\u2019ve been able to continue the conversation with him, but I\u2019ll leave the rest of the story for another day.>_Do you want to miss out on the joy of sharing the most amazing news, and bringing people another step closer to Jesus? I know I don\u2019t!_Obeying the promptings may seem scary at times, but it\u2019s only by starting and practice that we grow.

Or sometimes, you just don\u2019t think about it at all.One of the things that hinder a lot of Christians from really living out a life on mission is a **lack of empathy.** A lot of factors come into play, but I believe one of the biggest factors of this hindrance is what I would call _\u201cComfortable Christianity.\u201d_> Comfortable Christianity can be dangerous in a sense that you can neglect the many opportunities out there to share\u00a0Jesus.\u00a0Most of the time, we just wait for people to share the Gospel to on a Sunday. Yet, all the other days we get to encounter a lot of people outside the church who need Jesus._Grab driver. Barber. Vendors. Janitors. Security guards. Officemates. Even our own families._We can be so good in showing our faith within the walls of our church but when it comes to the reality of encountering people outside church, we can easily neglect opportunities.\u00a0> It\u2019s not a lack of theology or equipping that hinders us, but a lack of empathy. We tend to forget that we were once like them\u200a\u2014\u200alost and in need of the\u00a0truth.\u00a0Every day is an opportunity lost when we forget that God puts us in environments where we can tell people about His amazing love. Sadly, we get so stuck in our Christian environment that we have more Christian friends than non-christian friends.We can lack confidence when sharing with strangers (or even friends) because we\u2019re unsure of the outcome if we mention God. While every person and every conversation will unfold differently, the needs of the person rarely change:**_Every person is searching for purpose and identity._**The challenge is knowing how to address those key needs in a way that will be received well by the person. So, don\u2019t just study the Bible for keys to share your faith, **study the people you\u2019re sharing it with.** There will be answers for you there too.How can you share Jesus boldly? Don\u2019t stay silent outside the comforts of your church. Acknowledge that every encounter with someone is an opportunity to tell him/her about the Gospel. Start a conversation, identify the need, and simply talk about Jesus."

        "body": "Becoming like Jesus is a huge part of a life on mission and without doubt the reason we were created. Christianity is often referred to as a journey. The journey of becoming more like Christ. Growing in love is central to that journey.To answer the question \u201cHow do we live like Jesus?\u201d we need to ask the question_ \u201cAre we loving like Jesus?\u201d_Love is an interesting topic these days. It has been been used and confused in so many ways, that its true meaning and purpose is often unknown. While this is sad, it is a huge opportunity for Christians to use the actions of true love to reconcile a lost humanity to Jesus.> To grow in our ability to reconcile people to Jesus, we must understand how to love like\u00a0Jesus.Scripture gives great description of how to love like Jesus:Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\u200a\u2014\u200a[**1 Corinthians 13:4\u20137**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-8&version=NIV)That is an impressive list! No doubt some points on this list challenge the way you and I currently interact with others and even interact with God. Something worth noting and possibly working on if that is the case.> Our ability to grow in love and live like Jesus is determined by our capacity to receive Love from Him and our willingness to worship\u00a0Him.We can only share from what we have. The list of actions of love from 1 Corinthians are all by-products of an ongoing connection with Jesus. So, to grow in love and live like Jesus _we must spend time with God and be in close relationship with Him._ We can only give what we have received.**Here are 3 practical and simple ways to intentionally posture our lives to receive from Christ to allow us to love like Christ\u2026**1. **Read Scripture about His love.** Find the passages that reveal God\u2019s heart towards you and the those yet to know Him.2. **Worship Him in love.** Experience God\u2019s loving presence and express your love back to Him through worship.3. **Pray and rest in His love. **Meditate and create daily rhythms in your life that revisit and explore God\u2019s tangible loving presence. This will cement you love for God and it will outflow to others.The devil will do everything to disconnect us from a strong relationship with God. He is fully aware of the power we have when we are in strong connection with Him. That is why we are so easily distracted when you begin to read the Bible or why things suddenly happen when we gave time to worship or pray.Let\u2019s commit to ensuring we are aware of where we stand with God, and continue to foster our connection to Him so we can live and love like Jesus, because The world needs us and the world needs Jesus."

        "body": "People\u2019s objections to faith are often because of bad experiences with religious people. They feel judged on a good/bad scale. Jesus said: \u201cDo not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\u201d (Matthew 7:1\u20132)Sadly, religious culture can be judgemental, and it can be hard to get out of, because right and wrong is embedded in our thinking. Judah Smith, in his book, \u2018Jesus Is _____\u2019 writes about this thinking:_\u201cHere\u2019s how I assure myself I\u2019m doing good. I make up rules to fit my standard of living, the I judge you by them. If you follow my rules, you\u2019re a good person. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a bad person. If you have stricter rules than me, you\u2019re a prude who needs to lighten up.\u201d_We create our own delusion by creating our own rules to make ourselves feel better because we haven\u2019t been as bad as others. However, God tells us we have all have sinned; we have all fallen short of the mark. Judah admits that his way of thinking is wrong. Can we do the same? If we can, we realise there is no need to avoid sinners. If fact there is a need to go out of our way to engage with sinners. We are no better than anyone else, we have all sinned and need Jesus\u2019 grace.>_Part of honestly sharing our faith is acknowledging with others our own inadequacy without God, and the great news that Jesus wants to welcome us into the family anyway._**If we must keep rules and judge others to feel good/worthy about ourselves, we\u2019re preaching the wrong Gospel.**"

        "body": "You want to share your faith, then, shock horror you come across someone who thinks differently to you! It can be confronting when people have different ideas and beliefs, especially when you find them to be totally against yours. Perhaps you\u2019ve come across people that are Christian\u2019s, and their beliefs don\u2019t line up with what you understand the Bible says. What do you do? Sometimes the differences are much more subtle, to the degree that it can be hard to pinpoint how two ideas, which seem so closely aligned, are missing the mark. Don\u2019t worry, this is not a time to panic, or to run.> There\u2019s no set formula or process that can be applied to any of these situations.I\u2019ll qualify this a little further; you _could_apply a set formula or process, but then that\u2019s not being guided by the Holy Spirit\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s not a great idea. Doing things in your own strength, and not God\u2019s isn\u2019t cool.I\u2019m reminded of a story someone told me years ago, about people that are hired to notice or spot fake money and stop fraud. They never study fake money. Instead, they spend countless hours looking at the real thing rather than anything flawed or fake. It\u2019s in looking at the real thing, that they easily notice the fake. In being presented the fake money, they would then be able to point out exactly wasn\u2019t right, not because they looked at the flaws, but because they know the real thing.When we spend hours upon hours, day after day studying and looking at the real thing\u200a\u2014\u200athat being God and His word, we too, will easily notice the fake. That\u2019s the easy part. The challenge for us, is to not make it our mission to start pointing out all the frauds or fakes, but instead; to be so aligned to the truth that our lives and words point people to look to Jesus.> We change the world, when our lives point people to experience Jesus for themselves.God made us all different, so different beliefs are ok, and God made us with the ability to choose\u200a\u2014\u200aso it would be super weird to think that people must think the same as you, right? We have to give people freedom to choose what they want to believe. This doesn\u2019t mean standing back, this means getting involved, to help point people to truth and give them opportunity to see the difference. So, practically how does this play out? Here are 3 possible ways\u20261. **Don\u2019t freak out\u200a**\u2014\u200aYou might stumble over words, your heart might race, you may not know what to say. Take a breath. Relax.\u00a0  [_Joshua 1:9_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+1%3A9&version=NLT)_\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is my command\u200a\u2014\u200abe strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.\u201d_2. **Don\u2019t get on your high moral horse\u200a**\u2014\u200aThat means don\u2019t come across as behaving in a haughty, self-righteous, or superior manner. Something might be totally abhorrent, disgusting, evil, immoral and totally not ok. Remember there is no-one without sin.  [_John 8:7_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A7&version=NLT)_\u200a\u2014\u200aThey kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, \u201cAll right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!\u201d_3. **Take time to engage\u200a**\u2014\u200aTalk, listen, ask questions, be kind, loving, gentle, patient and have self-control. Seek answers to understand first and take time to engage in meaningful conversation and if you have opportunity, give reasons as to why you believe.  [_1 Peter 3:15\u201316_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15-16&version=NLT)_\u200a\u2014\u200aInstead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ._The Holy Spirit is the one who brings correction, conviction, and changes hearts. That means, it takes all the pressure off you, and how you perform. All you have to do is listen to the Holy Spirit and obey.**Stay gentle, stay strong and point people to Jesus.**"

Often they throw back something like \u201cbecause I said so\u201d or \u201cbecause it\u2019s disgusting to go to the loo on the lawn!\u201d But what are they to know? They are simply young humans yearning to understand the why behind what we do.>_There is a danger as Christians that we might fall into living a life of action without understanding the why behind that action. This is why is it so important to return to fundamentally important questions, such as \u2018Why should I share my faith?\u2019_Why should we share our faith? It is a very good question. A question that I think we should be continuously asking. It keeps us grounded to why we do what we do. So, why? Here are 3 reasons\u2026##3 Reasons to Share Your Faith##**We share because Jesus told us to.** In the book of Matthew (28:19), Jesus himself commands his followers to \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations\u201d. Nowhere is excluded, none is left out, the Gospel is for all and we are called to be the vehicles of that message. By the power of the Holy Spirit, we are equipped and qualified to share this message of hope and reconciliation. We are invited to be apart of the greatest love story ever told.**We share because we love.** There is a beautiful story in the book of John about a Samaritan woman and her encounter with Jesus at a drinking well. In this narrative, Jesus tells this woman that whoever is in a relationship with Him will never go thirsty again\u200a\u2014\u200athey will drink living water and be filled with life. Do you ever look around and see the world thirsty for hope? Thirsty for meaning? Thirsty for purpose? Thirsty for love? And we hold the answer\u2026 Jesus. If you were lost in the desert and you found water, surely you wouldn\u2019t just keep it for yourself? Because we love, we share.**We share because good news travels.**I am sure we have all been a part of a message chain of great news. A new baby, an engagement or a new promotion. Our message of Jesus is a message of great news and good news travels.A good friend of mine many years ago was invited to church by his university roommate. At the time an atheist, my friend reluctantly went along (mainly for the free food) and was met not only by good food, nice people but powerfully by a God who wholeheartedly and unconditionally loves him. Over a decade later, my good friend now leads a city centre church in the UK, connecting with thousands of university students every week and seeing a city transformed by Jesus. How valuable was that invitation?>_You see, when we are willing to share our faith we create new avenues for the Gospel to run like wildfire._"

Now, I know like anyone, Dan would have his down days, but even in the midst of downers Dan is up. He\u2019s real, he wears his heart on his sleeve, and he keeps smiling through it all.**Dan has this way about him that causes you to go through what I would call \u2018the uncomfortable zone\u2019.** There\u2019s this boldness about him that is contagious because it comes with this authenticity that is uniquely him\u200a\u2014\u200ahe doesn\u2019t try to be anyone else.

We raise a God standard and people take notice."

        "body": "Have you ever met someone you really wanted to get along with, but couldn\u2019t? You scramble through questions, hoping to discover an interest you share, or a hobby you both indulge in, but to no avail.\u00a0On paper, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard find something, _anything,_ you have in common. Unfortunately, this is a common experience, and it happens not only in meeting new people but also in sharing your faith.There have been times when I wanted to share my faith with someone but I felt defeated before I even tried. The person just seemed so different from me, their beliefs were so clearly opposed to the values I lived by. No matter how hard I tried to find the common ground between what the Bible taught and what they believed, I couldn\u2019t find it. It bothered me for days afterwards. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to find something we both believed in, right? After praying and seeking counsel from friends and mentors, I learned that _there is always common ground when it comes to faith._\u00a0_Faith itself is common among all people_. No matter who you are, where you\u2019re from, what you\u2019ve done, or what you\u2019ve experienced, you believe in _something._\u00a0Some people believe that money can solve all their problems, others trust in power. There are those that think information can save them, others still rely on luck to guide them through life. These idols come in many different forms and bear many different names; some of them we might even be familiar with and accepted by the rest of the world.\u00a0> The point is not to simply destroy these idols or expose the folly of these beliefs, but instead to turn those who rely on them towards belief in the True God, the only one that can ever save, Jesus\u00a0Christ.**\u00a0Our goal in evangelism is to tell people the good news that the God that we are all searching for has come to the earth and has died to save sinners, He has risen again proving that He has won victory over sin and death.** We tell them about the new life that they can have in Christ if they abandon the idols they rely on and fully trust in Jesus who has loved them with His life. The gospel doesn\u2019t stop with our words, but continues in the way we treat them, with love and respect, kindness and understanding, we treat them in the way God has treated us.As we seek to reach as many people as we can, let\u2019s keep in mind that no matter how different we might seem from one another we all believe in something. We have the common ground of faith to start the conversation from, and from there we can lead them to Jesus.------------------------Written by Jama Javier"

        "title": "Share Jesus Tip: Keep Prayer At The\u00a0Core",
        "body": "Prayer is one of the most powerful things we can do. The Bible talks a lot about prayer, so it\u2019s important we know how to do it. Especially because it is such a core part of living effectively \u2018on mission\u2019.> It\u2019s often overcomplicated, but at face value, prayer is simply just speaking with\u00a0God.How did Jesus pray? When asked, Jesus taught His disciples to pray in a particular way. His prayer is known as \u2018The Lord\u2019s Prayer\u2019 and is the perfect place to start when wanting to know how to pray._\u201cOur Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil._[Matthew 6:9\u201313](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9-13&version=AMPC)In this prayer, Jesus gives us a list of key things to do when we pray, let me break down each section\u2026This reminds us that God is our Father (who lives in Heaven), and we are His children (who live on earth). He loves us very much and is very approachable about any topic, so we need not pray in fear. It also reminds us that God is God and we are not. We right-size God in our minds by contemplating His awesomeness. This helps us remember that He is in control.This reminds us that our purpose is to see God\u2019s Kingdom expand on the earth. This is essentially praying that people who don\u2019t know God would come to know Him**.** Doing this is extremely healthy, because it also keeps our eyes focused on others and allows God\u2019s love for people to grow in our heart. It also reminds us to surrender our will to Him, and ask God to lead us, rather than leading ourselvesThis reminds us to ask for what we need each day and be thankful for the tangible things in life. It can also mean spiritual revelation. If there is something about God or in the Bible that you don\u2019t understand, ask you to make the meaning clear to you.This reminds us to ask for forgiveness for our wrongs while also reminding us to forgive those who wrong us. We need to forgive others in order for God to forgive us, so forgive them before God in prayer.This reminds us to ask God to strengthen us as we follow His will. Ask God to help you overcome temptation, break unhealthy life habits and choose His way for our lives. This is also a reminder to pray for God\u2019s protection from the plans of the devil to bring us harm.> Relationship with God is actually an ongoing conversation God. As you practice throughout the day, expect to see God do amazing\u00a0things.Prayer isn\u2019t just about our needs. Whether it is rightsizing God, listening for His voice to know His will, praying for others to know Him, or to forgive others. It\u2019s so much bigger than our own needs and desires.> Praying for those who don\u2019t know God is so important.We all know people who haven\u2019t yet made a decision to follow Jesus. God wants us to pray for them and encourage them to follow Him, so that their lives can be blessed by friendship with Him.As you pray, you will notice God will increase the love you have for those who don\u2019t yet know Him. Act on this love, and share with them about what God is doing in your life. An opportunity to know Jesus is the best gift you can give to anyone.Salvation is the first step to this exciting journey, and so you can help others embark on this first step in the God journey by sharing about Jesus with them.It starts with prayer."

        "title": "Your Greatest Ability Is Your Availability",
        "body": "I remember it clearly like it was yesterday. I was stuck at a busy intersection behind a woman in a red station wagon. My car air conditioning had recently stopped working and the sun bore down like a blanket of fire. My mind could not fathom the thought process of the person in the vehicle before me. 2 minutes of earnest waiting seemed like 2 weeks. It was the opportune moment, why she couldn\u2019t turn the corner, I still don\u2019t know. Every muscle in my body was tense. My fingers were sore from tapping, my upper lip cramped and my patience thinned. Every millimetre of my voice box ached from holding frustrated words within. There had been so many breaks in traffic, yet she wouldn\u2019t move.Have you ever wondered why we get frustrated sitting in traffic behind slow-minded drivers, or deep down build rage when we miss the green and hit red at the traffic light? Is it the diminishing time in our day? The old adage that time is money and money makes the world go round, so to lose that time means you lose the money and your miscalculation at the lights makes the world stop spinning? Is it that we have become such a need and want \u2018right now\u2019 society that if we have to wait, it is not worth it? Is it that we rule our own lives so well that we treat ourselves like royalty and expect the same treatment from others?>_Your greatest ability is your availability._Often I don\u2019t think that is the case. I think we try and circumvent our frustration by blaming it on time or blaming it on need or ego. Think about this, if we were to remove time from the equation for a moment and destroy the inner wants of instant gratification, even take a step aside from what we need and look again at the busy intersection scenario. The only thing left standing is opportunity.As I sat behind the women at the intersection, all that sat before her and I was opportunity. Gap after gap in traffic went past but she refused to seize the moment. I was not upset because she was wasting my time. More so it was that deep down sense, that inner whirlwind that needed to see others successfully grasp their opportunities. It is built within us all. The need for more, the need to grow, change and advance in life. So to witness opportunity after opportunity fall breathlessly to the ground hurts even onlookers to a situation._Humanity is built on individuals, individuals within communities, communities who work together for a common good. So to see another individual in absence of opportunity hurts the greater community.We as the Christians are working together not only for the common good but also for the eternal good and the eternal good requires us to live a counter cultural life._When a person we are connected to flourishes, we too flourish. When your church flourishes, the greater church flourishes. So when those before us miss their opportunities we miss ours. The truth of the situation was, that I could not receive my opportunity to turn the corner until she accepted her opportunity.That\u2019s not to say we cannot live our lives and accomplish great things until those before us do. More so, _I believe the greatest things we accomplish with our lives are found when we help others take their opportunities._ Accomplishments shouldn\u2019t be about who we are or what have become, but rather what others become because of who we are.In the Bible Jesus had the audacity to add extra commandments to scripture. He took what humanity knew to date as their guidance to life, the 10 commandments and lifted the bar. He said in:_John 13:34 \u2018A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\u2019 And then again in Mark 12:30: \u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength. The second most important command is this: Love your neighbour the same as you love yourself. These two commands are the most important.\u2019_In a world that is so self-focused, it may seem counter cultural to prescribe a dose of \u2018loving others\u2019, but it\u2019s funny, when we snap out of our selfish mode to love others with the same grace and love that Christ has for us, suddenly the predicaments we find ourselves in often become opportunities.**Sometimes we must be counter cultural and do what we don\u2019t want to do to help others do what they were called to do.**What are the opportunities in others lives that we are ignoring in a pursuit of our own? Who could you help today? When we come with a heart to love and serve, it disarms and shocks people. Often our offers of service provide a platform for us to speak into people\u2019s lives.People spend their lives searching for identity and purpose, which they don\u2019t know are found in Christ. How great would it be to have a platform where people want to listen to what we say about Christ because they have first seen that we care.**Your greatest ability is your availability. Who are you making yourself available for today?**"

Do you have tips for anyone who wants to, but is scared by what people may think of you?\u201d_It can be quite daunting at times to share your faith, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. As someone who shares their faith often, there are times I get scared too!>_Fear is a natural emotion, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a normal behaviour._I have learnt to overcome any fear by saying a simple statement to myself: \u201cIt is the Creator of the Universe that sends me and He promises to be with me\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahow good is that! The God that created me also sends me, and then I go.**I have committed to always doing these 3 things\u2026**1. **Pray** and ask God for boldness2. **Listen** for the Holy Spirit prompts as I go about my day3. **Jump** at the opportunities that present themselvesI\u2019ve had to learn to jump. Let me explain, it\u2019s something that has come with experience, with time and with my own self awareness\u2026You know those times when you feel a little disappointing \u2018pang\u2019 in your heart because you just didn\u2019t have the courage to open your mouth and say something? Or the racing heart beat that after a while settles down to normal pace and you think to yourself \u2018phew\u2019, it was lucky that moment passed! I\u2019ve got better at recognising my excuses and being aware that those moments were for a reason and that it was God prompting me to do something.Every time I miss the opportunity, I ask God for forgiveness and ask Him for another chance.Every time I hear myself saying \u201cIs that really you God?\u201d or having one of those moments of panic where I try and talk myself out it\u200a\u2014\u200aI stop myself and just go! That way my thoughts don\u2019t have time to talk me out of action. It gets easier the more you do it. Plus, a little bit of nervousness never hurt anyone \ud83d\ude09.I thank God for the nervousness cause it reminds me that I am relying on Him instead of myself and thinking that I have all the answers.Every person you talk to is different and every situation requires the Holy Spirit to guide you\u200a\u2014\u200awhen you forget that, you take over and honestly, when it\u2019s just us talking (without the Holy Spirit) we make a bit of a hash job.Sometimes I say to the person, _\u201cExcuse me. I just know God wants me to talk to you about Him and I\u2019m a bit nervous\u200a\u2014\u200ahave you been asking God some questions lately?\u201d_When you put all the weight of the conversation back onto God, you can smile, relax, enjoy yourself and expect that when you open your mouth something understandable will come out.If you do find yourself a blubbering bumbling mess, just take a big breath, have a laugh, go red (if you\u2019re like me I go red in the face sometimes), \u2018calm the farm\u2019 and just carry on! \ud83d\ude1c"

        "title": "FAQ: What Do I Say To Someone Who Asks \u2018Why Does God Allow Evil?\u2019",
        "body": "The question of evil is possibly one of the most common barriers to people coming into a relationship with God. Questions like; \u201cHow can God let that happen?\u201d, \u201cHow can a good God allow evil?\u201d or, \u201cIf God cared wouldn\u2019t He stop evil from happening?\u201dI used to be one of those people that wanted to try and defend God. The more I got to know God, the more I realised He doesn\u2019t need me to defend Him.> That meant I didn\u2019t have to have all the\u00a0answers.I just had to get good at asking the right questions to get understanding and then help point people towards Jesus. It also meant that I had to be approachable and kind; it doesn\u2019t help anyone to get upset, or to get offended.What am I saying in all of this? How do you respond to someone asking a question about God allowing evil?You respond with a question and then engage well in having a conversation. Here are some examples of what you could ask:1. Why do you feel this way?  This means taking time to understand, why they\u2019ve asked the question in the first place. As an example; If your mother had died, and you genuinely felt God was not only responsible for killing her but also happy about it, would you want to follow a God like that? I know I wouldn\u2019t! This may seem like an extreme example, but the reality is, there are actually many people that think this way.2. What has happened?  This helps to establish where the pain point is and goes a little deeper to find out more of the story. Listen carefully to the answer, as more often than not, you will find something that doesn\u2019t line up with God\u2019s truth.3. What is your solution?  Conversation is so important, and it\u2019s not about you having to give all the answers, so why not throw their question back and ask them what their solution is. It can be really helpful to see if they have considered this.Once you\u2019ve taken time to understand why the question was asked, you can then filter what you\u2019ve heard, and draw on God\u2019s truth for a response. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to have all the answers, and take care not to give responses that you don\u2019t know for yourself. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re still having questions about God\u2019s goodness, look at it as an opportunity for you to grow in your own faith, just be careful not to reflect your own doubts onto the person or the situation.God\u2019s love is never forced; if it was, it wouldn\u2019t be love, it would be control. That means we all have choice. When you make a decision to follow God He promises to guide and lead you\u200a\u2014\u200aHe wants you to succeed and do well, He has greats plans for every person. If people don\u2019t want to follow God\u2019s plans, He gives us choice and lets us walk away from those plans; those decisions can, and do, affect others. It\u2019s important you get to know God well, and get to know His nature and character so that instead of blaming God, you run to Him for answers. Be real, if it\u2019s something you struggle with also, this is a great time to discover truth together.Here are a few points to help you line up with God\u2019s truth:God is good\u200a\u2014\u200a_1 John 1:5; This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all._God is the solution\u200a\u2014\u200a_Romans 5:3\u20136; We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love. When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners._God is faithful\u200a\u2014\u200a_1 Corinthians 10:13; The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure._Sometimes it can be easy to want to run from questions or situations that you don\u2019t understand or that you find hard to answer. Can I encourage you not to run, but to use this as an opportunity to get to know God better and to help some people along the way.You may enjoy reading some more articles on this topic:  [My Thoughts on Stephen Fry](https://thejourney.yesheis.com/my-thoughts-on-stephen-fry-aaf82a6d808)  [Why Does God Allow Evil?](https://thejourney.yesheis.com/why-does-god-allow-evil-795fa825c3ff)"

        "body": "I recently spoke with Sarah, a young woman who shares her faith daily online. 18 months ago she had never lead anyone to Christ, but it\u2019s almost a weekly occurrence.She has gone from being nervous to share anything about Jesus, to someone who takes a conversation about Him in her stride without a second thought.What happened? Here\u2019s what she said:\u201cAt the beginning, sharing your faith can be daunting and fear can stop you from jumping in with boldness. however, like everything, the more you practice the more confident you become. There are many things personally that can hold you back, but when you allow Jesus to work in your life, you can transform this world into His Kingdom.When I first started my journey in sharing my faith it did not go as easily as I thought. But that didn\u2019t stop me. I grew in my confidence by just doing it! I jumped into the deep end and I learnt through action.> The biggest part of me learning to be confident was learning that Jesus always had my back and He was wanting me to give it a\u00a0go.I found the more I leant on trusting the Holy Spirit and His promptings, the more fun and freedom I had. I become more confident to step out into deeper waters. With every hard question or series of harsh words in a conversation, I would remember Jesus\u2019 unconditional love for me which would remind me that Jesus loves this person in the same way.> The more I saw people as Jesus saw them, the less fear took over and the more confident I became in sharing my faith. I knew that people need Jesus as much as I\u00a0do.I always think back to life without Jesus, or a time that I was struggling where I needed Him more than ever. That would remind me there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus for themselves.My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHe must become greater; I must become less\u201d.> When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don\u2019t know\u00a0Jesus.The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus\u2019 love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.Don\u2019t be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It\u2019s has been one of my biggest learning curves but it\u2019s been one of my best.Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\u201d"

What an opportunity, yet also, what a challenge!Generally speaking, over the years, we (as Christians) have shot ourselves in the foot by combining and paraphrasing Bible verses from\u00a0[Romans 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=NIV)\u00a0&\u00a0[John 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17&version=NIV)\u00a0to say \u201c_Be in the world but not of the world_\u201d which in turn has often been taken as \u201c_Be not in the world at all!_\u201d Unfortunately, this developed a culture which shunned any action or behaviour considered to be \u2018worldly\u2019 and in turn developed Christian subcultures where most of the time spent was in the company of other Christians. This has slowly led to us unconsciously find ourselves void of non-Christian friends and void of opportunities to share Jesus. This was and is a problem.> The good thing is, there is a solution! Simply, the solution is find yourself in places where you aren\u2019t only surrounded by Christians and make\u00a0friends.Proximity breeds passion. When you are close to people, you become passionate about them. When you are close to need, you become passionate about meeting the need. So the best way to make friends and share Jesus with them is to become close to non-Christians and understand their needs. The world is a large place with a lot of people. So get out there!##### Here are a few ways to get you\u00a0started\u20261. Join a local sports team2. Join a gym3. Volunteer at a local community centre4. Invite your neighbours over for a BBQWhile doing that, you could also start sharing your faith online.\u00a0[Here](https://thejourney.yesheis.com/share-your-faith-with-a-complete-stranger-online-db1337e42108)\u00a0is a quick blog on how sharing Jesus with strangers online.

        "body": "A Terrorist killed innocent people again recently. Attacks that used to shock us are now common news stories, yet they still leave us sad, stunned and confused.> I believe the only way to stop terrorism is with the\u00a0Gospel.Terrorism these days is immediately associated with Islam and this association brings a huge amount of hatred towards Muslims. However, if the answer to terrorism is the Gospel, then hatred is not the way to bring resolution. As Christians we need to show love to Muslims, get to know them, ask them questions about their faith and share the truth of the Gospel with them. There are many stories of Muslims coming to faith in Jesus through Christians doing just this.> The Bible says there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in\u00a0love.A colleague of mine, has spent much of his life living and working with Muslims and knows much about the Islam Faith. He says:It may sound strange but most terrorists are motivated by fear. Fear of death, fear of betrayal by their comrades or fear that their sacrifices, even the ultimate self-sacrifice of their life may not make them acceptable to God. Fear manifests itself in bizarre ways\u200a\u2014\u200athrough hatred or anger etc. Each of which are fear by another name.When considering the power of positive change through love rather than fear, the story of a former self-confessed terrorist, Solomon* comes to mind:_\u201cSteeped in radical Islamic jihad from an early age, my overriding aim in life was to purge all non-Muslims and non-Islamic influences from Muslim nations to liberate them from these pagan influences. To that end I planned and conducted terror operations in the Middle East, Southeast and Central Asia.__It was only when I began to be personally convicted of all the blood I had shed that I started to realise the awful truth about my selfish sacrifices. My practice of jihad and willingness to give my life and take the lives of others was a vain attempt, based on fear, at propitiating (paying for) my own salvation through selfish-sacrifice.__Fortunately, I realised that this macabre form of religious altruism was cursing me and my jihadist colleagues and the lands we were supposed to be liberating by the blood we were spilling.\u201d_Unfortunately, many of Solomon\u2019s jihadist colleagues in Daesh or Islamic State continue with these vain attempts to gain peace and paradise.Solomon is my friend. Every time we meet, Solomon hugs and kisses me. He says,\u00a0_\u201cI want you to know that I love you my brother. Once I feared and killed people like you, but now I am filled with the love of Christ for you and my fellow men.\u201d\u00a0_You cannot beat your enemy with bombs or money. Perfect love casts out fear.As followers of Christ let\u2019s be committed to 3 things\u20261. Prayer for the Gospel to spread like wildfire in countries where Islam is the most influential religion.2. Learning more about the religion of Islam and the politics of the Middle East.3. Not allowing our minds to fall into the trap of believing that every Muslim is a terrorist. Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to hate or fear an entire group of people.Jesus Christ changes lives! He once took what would be the equivalent of a \u201cterrorist\u201d (Paul, who was killing Christians) and turned him into one of the Gospel\u2019s all time greatest proclaimers.If He did it back then He can do it again!Name and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of the individual."

You presented all the right arguments, you shared personal testimony, and the person still refused to consider an alternate point of view? It makes you want to give up on them. But have you considered that there is something more important at stake?> For every argument we win, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve won the person. In fact the opposite is often true, and we can distance the person from discussions about God and\u00a0faith.When a conversation turns into a debate, it sets up a \u2018them and us\u2019 pretence for the conversation, and puts people on the defensive. From that point on, everything you say requires a rebuttal. In a debate, most people prefer to be seen as right, rather than actually be right. This makes it hard for anything you say to cut through their defensiveness.Change tactics. Avoid the debate. Rather, share experiences with each other. Listen to their stories, and tell them of situations where God intervened in your life and did something amazing. Then ask if they would like to experience the same. You could even offer to pray for them. Even if they say no, you can leave the conversation having won the friendship rather than the argument.Winning an argument against a non-Christian can create tension in the friendship and close the door to future opportunities to share in a more positive way. Win the person, and continue to disciple them."

There were politicians, academics, laymen, women, children, the rich and the poor in His crowds.

        "body": "Becoming like Jesus is a huge part of a life on mission and without doubt the reason we were created. Christianity is often referred to as a journey. The journey of becoming more like Christ. Growing in love is central to that journey.To answer the question \u201cHow do we live like Jesus?\u201d we need to ask the question \u201cAre we loving like Jesus?\u201dLove is an interesting topic these days. It has been been used and confused in so many ways, that its true meaning and purpose is often unknown. While this is sad, it is a huge opportunity for Christians to use the actions of true love to reconcile a lost humanity to Jesus.> To grow in our ability to reconcile people to Jesus, we must understand how to love like\u00a0Jesus.1 Corinthians 13:4\u20137 gives great description of how to love like Jesus:Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.> \u00a0It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.> \u00a0Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\u200a\u2014\u200a[1 Corinthians 13:4\u20137](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-8&version=NIV)That is an impressive list! No doubt some points on this list challenge the way you and I currently interact with others and even interact with God. Something worth noting and possibly working on if that is the case.> Our ability to grow in love and live like Jesus is determined by our capacity to receive Love from Him and our willingness to worship\u00a0Him.We can only share from what we have. The list of actions of love from 1 Corinthians are all byproducts of an ongoing connection with Jesus. So, to grow in love and live like Jesus we must spend time with God and be in close relationship with Him. We can only give what we have received.Here are 3 practical and simple ways to intentionally posture our lives to receive from Christ to allow us to love like Christ\u20261. Read Scripture about His love.\u00a0Find the passages that reveal God\u2019s heart towards you and the those yet to know Him.2. Worship Him in love.\u00a0Experience God\u2019s loving presence and express your love back to Him through worship.3. Pray and rest in His love.\u00a0Meditate and create daily rhythms in your life that revisit and explore God\u2019s tangible loving presence. This will cement you love for God and it will outflow to others.The devil will do everything to disconnect us from a strong relationship with God. He is fully aware of the power we have when we are in strong connection with Him. That is why we are so easily distracted when you begin to read the Bible or why things suddenly happen when we gave time to worship or pray.Let\u2019s commit to ensuring we are aware of where we stand with God, and continue to foster our connection to Him so we can live and love like Jesus, because The world needs us and the world needs Jesus."

        "body": "God loves to give out wisdom. He doesn\u2019t distribute it loosely though. He gives it to those who specifically ask for it. Two examples are Solomon and Paul in the Bible. Solomon desired wisdom so he could lead God\u2019s people. Paul asked for wisdom so he could boldly share the Gospel.> When it comes to sharing our faith today, we need to be as wise as snakes yet as innocent as\u00a0doves.Wisdom isn\u2019t normally an attribute you would associate with snakes, however they are very clever. They don\u2019t go picking fights, rather, quietly and calmly they depart from dangerous situations. They have very clear eyesight, a phenomenal sense of smell and can hear through vibrations. They sense trouble coming from a mile away.When it comes to sharing faith, each of those attributes, coupled with the gentle and meek qualities of a dove will ensure you can handle each situation. Easier said than done however, which is why we need to daily ask Jesus to grant us wisdom. Wisdom to know when to speak and when to listen. Wisdom to know how to answer. Wisdom to know when to calmly walk away from a fruitless conversation.[_James 1:5_](http://stfi.re/nvyvyde)_\u00a0\u201cIf you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you.

I love you Jesus! Now I am baptised, I\u2019ve taken a lifetime decision to follow Jesus and know Him more everyday.

        "title": "3 Tips to Share Your\u00a0Faith",
        "body": "When talking with friends, sometimes we can be over zealous in enthusiasm to share the truth we know, and our friends can sometimes feel like they are being talked at, rather than talked to, or listened to. Now, I don\u2019t want to curb your enthusiasm, so here are 3 practical tips to help.There\u2019s a fantastic scripture in the Bible, [1 Peter 3:15\u201317](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15-17&version=NIV)\u200a\u2014\u200a> But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God\u2019s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.It\u2019s important that we spend time in conversation to understand their journey, viewpoints and experiences.\u00a0##### Don\u2019t be offended if your friend is really negative about God, offense breeds contention, and that\u2019s the last thing you\u00a0need.\u00a0In a situation like this, a good way to respond would be something like; \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that you feel that way, can you explain why?\u201d Try to read between the lines and listen to what is not being said. You will start to notice areas of pain, distrust, anger, sadness etc, keep them in mind as the conversation continues.##### Ask God to help you be a carrier of kindness.\u00a0God\u2019s loving kindness leads us to repentance ([Romans 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+2%3A4&version=NIV)). Kindness isn\u2019t about agreeing, but it\u2019s speaking truth in love. Be careful not to jump to your own conclusions about why your friends are responding in a particular manner, listen to the Holy Spirit and ask questions. Asking questions is a fabulous way to get understanding, and it helps keep the conversation open and friendly.Discipleship and evangelism go hand in hand. Our behaviours and our actions disciple people, the question is what sort of discipleship are we presenting? Take a look at [Ephesians 5:15\u201320](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A15-20&version=NIV)\u200a\u2014\u200a_Be very careful, then, how you live\u200a\u2014\u200anot as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity._##### Be intentional with your choice of words. Sometimes without thinking we start using words that would only be heard in church or read in the\u00a0Bible.\u00a0Your friends will understand you better if you use everyday language. In conversation, avoid words like; atonement for your sin, blood of the lamb, born again, sanctification, or hedge of protection.Whether your conversation is online or offline, always take time to consider how to respond to your friends. Trust that the Holy Spirit will guide you as you speak\u200a\u2014\u200aand of course you\u2019re praying for your friends already right?Being vulnerable as we share our lives with others helps them see we are not some super human, but, just like them, we also struggle. People connect with stories. As much as possible try to share through story telling. Can you relate the situation to a personal experience you\u2019ve had?"

We partnered with Elevate (a youth movement) in talking about how to reach out to the youth through campuses and the online space.> Our goal has always been the same\u200a\u2014\u200ato equip believers to really take action and share their faith, whether offline or online. We also educate them on how to use the yesHEis app as a personal evangelism assistant for their faith-sharing journey.But I have to stop for a moment\u2026I go back to the introduction of this article: _When was the last time I trembled at the Word of God? _I can hardly remember. I\u2019m not even sure if it actually happened.We can think of the most effective strategies to evangelize and disciple, but if our vertical relationship with God is nowhere to be found, then what we have are just programs. **Our intimacy with Him should be the foundation of a Spirit-filled life.**How can we make an impact in today\u2019s generation without watering down the truth that will truly a person free from sin?##### **STAY RELEVANT BUT ROOTED IN GOD\u2019S\u00a0WORD****\u00a0**The word of God should make you tremble at the holy presence of God. It should keep you grounded, humbled and in awe of His beauty and majesty. At the end of the day, we look to a God who is holy, holy, holy.> When everything else is gone, when all the externals are taken away from you, and you\u2019re left with nothing else but your relationship with God, how would that look\u00a0like?It\u2019s refreshing to be reminded that our personal intimacy with God is what keeps our faith authentic and true. Not programs. Not ministries. Not Christian books. Not our Pastors. Not conferences. Not even the yesHEis App.I end this article with a simple encouragement: Before you tell people to come to Jesus, _ask yourself if you are truly soaking in His presence._"

        "body": "We know Christians have been called to share the love of Jesus with their world, but for many of us this is still a scary thought, no matter how long we\u2019ve been saved.  Putting yourself out there and sharing about your personal relationship with God can be truly daunting - but maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019ve somehow decided that the responsibility for the whole deal lies solely on our own shoulders?There might be someone you know who really needs to know that God loves them and that they can find hope in the person of Jesus Christ.  The question is how?  How do you find the perfect opening to share? How do you put together compelling reasons for faith? How do you share your faith in such a way that your friend can\u2019t help but believe that Jesus loves them? The simple answer \u2013 you don\u2019t.  If you\u2019re waiting for the perfect moment, perfect delivery and perfect argument you will never share anything with anyone because it\u2019s not about you.  Jesus never intended to leave us to walk out the great commission of sharing His love on our own.  He promised to be with us and the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit is there to teach us and remind us of everything that Jesus has told us. So, when we go into the world to share the Good News about Jesus we don\u2019t go in our own power.  Sharing your faith is a partnership \u2013 the Holy Spirit and you.  It\u2019s up to you to make the introduction but it\u2019s up to Him to touch the heart and open eyes to the truth about Jesus.     "

If you want to share your faith with friends and family, I\u2019m not suggesting that you learn French or Spanish\u2026 that would be pointless (unless your friend happens to be French of course) but sometimes the words we use to when sharing our faith sound like a foreign language to people who don\u2019t go to church or read the Bible.  If you\u2019ve been in church for a while or move in mostly Christian circles, it\u2019s very likely that you speak \u2018Christianese\u2019 - a form of English that doesn't always translate into the outside world - and you probably don't realise it.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with this generally but it can make sharing the hope that can be found through a relationship with Jesus much harder than it needs to be.  Seemingly simple words like \u2018grace\u2019, \u2018sin\u2019, \u2018repentance\u2019 and even \u2018Born Again\u2019 can be confusing or misunderstood if someone hasn\u2019t been exposed to Christianity before.  Think about the words you would use to explain why you follow Jesus. Is there another way to say that you\u2019ve been \u2018saved by God\u2019s grace\u2019? Maybe something along the lines of you\u2019ve been \u2018forgiven and can have a relationship with Jesus because of God\u2019s generous goodness\u2019? It doesn\u2019t need to be complicated or scary but just considering the way you communicate who Jesus is, why He\u2019s made a difference in your life and how they can know Him too can make the world of difference.

        "body": "I recently spoke with Sarah, a young woman who shares her faith daily online. 18 months ago she had never lead anyone to Christ, but it\u2019s almost a weekly occurrence.She has gone from being nervous to share anything about Jesus, to someone who takes a conversation about Him in her stride without a second thought.What happened? Here\u2019s what she said:\u201cAt the beginning, sharing your faith can be daunting and fear can stop you from jumping in with boldness. however, like everything, the more you practice the more confident you become. There are many things personally that can hold you back, but when you allow Jesus to work in your life, you can transform this world into His Kingdom.When I first started my journey in sharing my faith it did not go as easily as I thought. But that didn\u2019t stop me. I grew in my confidence by just doing it! I jumped into the deep end and I learnt through action.The biggest part of me learning to be confident was learning that Jesus always had my back and He was wanting me to give it a go.I found the more I leant on trusting the Holy Spirit and His promptings, the more fun and freedom I had. I become more confident to step out into deeper waters. With every hard question or series of harsh words in a conversation, I would remember Jesus\u2019 unconditional love for me which would remind me that Jesus loves this person in the same way.>_The more I saw people as Jesus saw them, the less fear took over and the more confident I became in sharing my faith. I knew that people need Jesus as much as I do._I always think back to life without Jesus, or a time that I was struggling where I needed Him more than ever. That would remind me there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus for themselves.My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHe must become greater; I must become less\u201d.>_When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don\u2019t know Jesus._The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus\u2019 love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.Don\u2019t be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It\u2019s has been one of my biggest learning curves but it\u2019s been one of my best.Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\u201d"

Sometimes we get ahead of ourselves and start preaching right away and we end up disappointed. Little do we realize that _love_ always points to the gospel.\u201cLove\u201d is mentioned over a hundred times in the Bible (check out 1 Corinthians 13, 1 John 4 for some of my favorites) but by far the epitome of love is illustrated in Jesus\u2019 death on the Cross:**\u201cThis is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us.

Is there a perfect time to bring up the topic? How do you introduce the subject to your friends? Somehow, we\u2019ve turned our faith into something that doesn\u2019t really get talked about unless we're 'sharing' it.  It\u2019s almost as though the only time we can talk about Jesus to people who aren\u2019t Christians is when we have a purpose or a reason to do so.  It's not wrong to talk about your relationship with God in order to let someone know that they can also know Him but maybe it would be better to introduce the subject of what you believe in a more relaxed, conversational way.  Allow your faith in God to be present in your conversation even when you\u2019re not necessarily trying to tell someone about Jesus.  If you\u2019re a Christian, talk about it, in everyday conversation! If you were a runner you\u2019d talk to your friends about your running shoes, your training and how you became a runner, even if they weren\u2019t interested in running.  Your goal wouldn\u2019t be to make them runners, you\u2019d just be talking about your life.  So why don\u2019t you treat your faith in the same way?  Do you go to church? Read your bible? Pray?

The guest suggested that the answer to the problem facing humanity was to dial everything back and do life from the inside out.  He suggested that we stop trying to fix the world\u2019s problems but start reconnecting with \u2018who we really are\u2019.  Isn\u2019t that really the question that most people are asking? There are enough books, seminars and podcasts related to the topic to suggest that they are.  However, it\u2019s deeper than \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Steve from Manchester and I\u2019m in sales\u2019.  It\u2019s even more than \u2018I\u2019m single\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m Scottish\u2019 or \u2018I have cancer\u2019.  Who we are goes beyond where we live, our relationship status, our nationality or the struggles we face and it\u2019s something that most people really struggle to give an answer to.  Who you are at the core of your being is not an easy question to answer but it\u2019s practically impossible who you take God out of the equation.  People who don\u2019t understand that we were made by a creator who desires to have a personal connection to us, base their understanding of who they are entirely on themselves and their own knowledge. Removing God from our existence completely will only ever give us part of the picture.  As someone who knows God and has had their relationship with Him restored through Jesus and His sacrifice of love, you have the missing piece of their puzzle.  Your faith in Jesus is the answer to the question many people are asking, even if they don\u2019t really know how to phrase it.  This is why we need to introduce people to Jesus.  There is a need in this world to reconnect to God and it\u2019s only through the person of Jesus Christ that this will ever be possible.

        "body": "The question of evil is possibly one of the most common barriers to people coming into a relationship with God. Questions like; \u201cHow can God let that happen?\u201d, \u201cHow can a good God allow evil?\u201d or, \u201cIf God cared wouldn\u2019t He stop evil from happening?\u201dI used to be one of those people that wanted to try and defend God. The more I got to know God, the more I realised He doesn\u2019t need me to defend Him.>_That meant I didn\u2019t have to have all the answers._I just had to get good at asking the right questions to get understanding and then help point people towards Jesus. It also meant that I had to be approachable and kind; it doesn\u2019t help anyone to get upset, or to get offended.What am I saying in all of this? How do you respond to someone asking a question about God allowing evil?You respond with a question and then engage well in having a conversation. Here are some examples of what you could ask:**Why do you feel this way?**This means taking time to understand, why they\u2019ve asked the question in the first place. As an example; If your mother had died, and you genuinely felt God was not only responsible for killing her but also happy about it, would you want to follow a God like that? I know I wouldn\u2019t! This may seem like an extreme example, but the reality is, there are actually many people that think this way.**What has happened?**This helps to establish where the pain point is and goes a little deeper to find out more of the story. Listen carefully to the answer, as more often than not, you will find something that doesn\u2019t line up with God\u2019s truth.**What is your solution?**Conversation is so important, and it\u2019s not about you having to give all the answers, so why not throw their question back and ask them what their solution is. It can be really helpful to see if they have considered this.Once you\u2019ve taken time to understand why the question was asked, you can then filter what you\u2019ve heard, and draw on God\u2019s truth for a response. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to have all the answers, and take care not to give responses that you don\u2019t know for yourself. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re still having questions about God\u2019s goodness, look at it as an opportunity for you to grow in your own faith, just be careful not to reflect your own doubts onto the person or the situation.God\u2019s love is never forced; if it was, it wouldn\u2019t be love, it would be control. That means we all have choice. When you make a decision to follow God He promises to guide and lead you\u200a\u2014\u200aHe wants you to succeed and do well, He has greats plans for every person. If people don\u2019t want to follow God\u2019s plans, He gives us choice and lets us walk away from those plans; those decisions can, and do, affect others. It\u2019s important you get to know God well, and get to know His nature and character so that instead of blaming God, you run to Him for answers. Be real, if it\u2019s something you struggle with also, this is a great time to discover truth together.**Here are a few points to help you line up with God\u2019s truth:****God is good**\u200a\u2014\u200a1 John 1:5; This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.**God is the solution**\u200a\u2014\u200aRomans 5:3\u20136; We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love. When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.**God is faithful**\u200a\u2014\u200a1 Corinthians 10:13; The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.Sometimes it can be easy to want to run from questions or situations that you don\u2019t understand or that you find hard to answer. Can I encourage you not to run, but to use this as an opportunity to get to know God better and to help some people along the way."

What happens when we feel weak?_**When we become believers, we don\u2019t magically grow immune to experiencing difficulties. **We can still go through heartbreak, we can still struggle to make ends meet, we can still have feelings of discontentment. Whatever pains we experience, they can be disheartening to a point where we don\u2019t exactly look strong or courageous.As someone who continues to struggle with anxiety in their Christian walk, I am also no stranger to feeling weak.

We come to realize that it\u2019s not about how good we are, how faithful we are, and most definitely not about how strong we are. It\u2019s about God. It\u2019s about how good God is, how faithful God is, and how strong God is.> \u00a0As receivers of the gospel, we are reminded about who we truly are in Christ and the fact that our identity is no longer found in ourselves but in\u00a0Him.> \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.\u201d (Galatians 3:26\u201327)When my identity is in Christ, I don\u2019t need to be the strongest version of myself. I will always pale in comparison to who He is. I do not need to hide my weakness or my lack, as it is God\u200a\u2014\u200athe One who made a way for my salvation, the one who raised Jesus from the grave\u200a\u2014\u200awho is the source of my strength.> \u201c[F]ear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.\u201d (Isaiah 41:10)As God did take away the thorn in Paul\u2019s flesh, whatever weakness and pain God has allowed to remain in your life has a purpose\u200a\u2014\u200aone of which is for the great purpose of relying on Him.\u00a0> In everything we do, from trusting in His goodness to sharing the gospel with an old friend, let it all be done with the strength that comes from the One we share a death and resurrection with.\u00a0For when our identity is found in Christ, our strength will also come from Him!----------Written by Natasha Mendoza"

        "body": "Have you ever been sharing about God and got caught in a debate that went nowhere? You presented all the right arguments, you shared personal testimony, and the person still refused to consider an alternate point of view? It makes you want to give up on them. But have you considered that there is something more important at stake?>_For every argument we win, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve won the person. In fact the opposite is often true, and we can distance the person from discussions about God and faith._When a conversation turns into a debate, it sets up a \u2018them and us\u2019 pretence for the conversation, and puts people on the defensive. From that point on, everything you say requires a rebuttal. In a debate, most people prefer to be seen as right, rather than actually be right. This makes it hard for anything you say to cut through their defensiveness.Change tactics. Avoid the debate. Rather, share experiences with each other. Listen to their stories, and tell them of situations where God intervened in your life and did something amazing. Then ask if they would like to experience the same. You could even offer to pray for them. Even if they say no, you can leave the conversation having won the friendship rather than the argument.Winning an argument against a non-Christian can create tension in the friendship and close the door to future opportunities to share in a more positive way. Win the person, and continue to disciple them."

We become the center of attention.I recently came across an article on TV actor Neil McDonough going viral on social media. He made a stand to never accept acting roles that would require him to kiss other women other than his wife.

They sense trouble coming from a mile away.When it comes to sharing faith, each of those attributes, coupled with the gentle and meek qualities of a dove will ensure you can handle each situation. Easier said than done however, which is why we need to daily ask Jesus to grant us wisdom. Wisdom to know when to speak and when to listen. Wisdom to know how to answer.

She\u2019s written her story:_\u201cThere were the dark days of my life where all my doors were shut; my family and my love on whom I depended so much. I was devastated, lost and hopeless. I believed in God, but at that time I didn\u2019t know what to do, or who to contact.__As always, God hears everyone that comes to Him. Morag helped me realise that God is there for me. She encouraged me and boosted my faith in Jesus. God proved to me this was his plan and that He is near to those that are hurting. I felt God made Morag talk to me regarding faith, belief and to showed me path to get connected to Jesus. She guided me to join a church and such awesome people who helped me to get closer to God.__As the verse in Isaiah 55:9 says \u201cAs heavens are higher than earth, my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than yours\u201d.

He is the one I talk to and share everything, I thank Him for what He has given me, and I ask Him to guide me. He knows everything about me, I have surrendered myself to Him and I want everything to happen in Godly way in my life.__Thank you Jesus. You are everything to me.

        "body": "We were all perfectly designed as emotional creatures. Even Jesus in His perfection experienced suffering. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrow, and acquainted with grief. (Isaiah 53:3) Living here on earth enabled Him to personally commune with His people by embracing human emotions\u200a\u2014\u200ayet He did not sin.\u00a0_We serve a relational God who reaches out and shares in our grief because He Himself faced it.\u00a0_Yet, using our emotions to guide our responses to circumstances can complicate matters and even lead to lifelong regrets. We have to stop handing our emotions power only God should wield over us.Christian missionary, Amy Carmichael, put it beautifully,\u201dIf the praise of others elates me and their blame depresses me; if I cannot rest under misunderstanding without defending myself; if I love to be loved more than to love, to be served more than to serve, then I know nothing of Calvary love.\u201dKnowing Calvary love means putting God\u2019s truth before our own.##### Not everything merits a response.Taking offense towards the smallest things can be a reflex response. You hear negative criticism towards your character and you immediately want to defend yourself. You see a 280-character tweet from a stranger you disagree with and jump on social media to give them a piece of your mind. If we simply spent time in prayer before exchanging shouts with the world, we won\u2019t be easily led by our emotions\u200a\u2014\u200aanger, sadness, fear, envy\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter how \u201cjustified\u201d they are at the moment.\u00a0When we set our thoughts on to praiseworthy things (Philippians 4:8) then we have an opportunity to filter out our thoughts and focus on God\u2019s unchanging truth about us.##### What are you feeding your emotions\u00a0with?What are you doing with your pain? The simple act of listening to sad music, binge-watching shows, or rereading old messages can intensify one\u2019s emotions and force you to dwell on things that don\u2019t contribute to healing. Who are you pouring your pain to? Different perspectives of people can corrupt your way of thinking. Depending on the company, they can add fuel to the fire and keep affirming your pain instead of resolving it and giving way to grace.\u00a0This is why genuine accountability matters.##### Do you need to know everything?There is insecurity rooted in information.\u00a0Have you ever wanted anybody to divulge details to feed your curiosity? Do you find yourself going that extra mile\u200a\u2014\u200alurking through social media platforms, opening e-mails or text messages\u200a\u2014\u200ajust to \u201csilence\u201d your inner demons?

Stop asking for answers you aren\u2019t ready to receive. But when He does give it, and it can hurt, He will equip us with grace to deal with it.##### Lead your heart before it leads\u00a0you.Following your heart, as the age-old saying goes, can often lead to mistakes.\u00a0Conform your emotions to Scripture in pursuit of Christlikeness.\u00a0When we bury our insecurities and don\u2019t place them on the feet of Jesus Christ, we deceive ourselves and God.

Perhaps you\u2019ve come across people that are Christian\u2019s, and their beliefs don\u2019t line up with what you understand the Bible says. What do you do? Sometimes the differences are much more subtle, to the degree that it can be hard to pinpoint how two ideas, which seem so closely aligned, are missing the mark. Don\u2019t worry, this is not a time to panic, or to run.> There\u2019s no set formula or process that can be applied to any of these situations.I\u2019ll qualify this a little further; you\u00a0_could_\u00a0apply a set formula or process, but then that\u2019s not being guided by the Holy Spirit\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s not a great idea. Doing things in your own strength, and not God\u2019s isn\u2019t cool.I\u2019m reminded of a story someone told me years ago, about people that are hired to notice or spot fake money and stop fraud. They never study fake money. Instead, they spend countless hours looking at the real thing rather than anything flawed or fake. It\u2019s in looking at the real thing, that they easily notice the fake. In being presented the fake money, they would then be able to point out exactly wasn\u2019t right, not because they looked at the flaws, but because they know the real thing.When we spend hours upon hours, day after day studying and looking at the real thing\u200a\u2014\u200athat being God and His word, we too, will easily notice the fake. That\u2019s the easy part. The challenge for us, is to not make it our mission to start pointing out all the frauds or fakes, but instead; to be so aligned to the truth that our lives and words point people to look to Jesus.> We change the world, when our lives point people to experience Jesus for themselves.God made us all different, so different beliefs are ok, and God made us with the ability to choose\u200a\u2014\u200aso it would be super weird to think that people must think the same as you, right? We have to give people freedom to choose what they want to believe. This doesn\u2019t mean standing back, this means getting involved, to help point people to truth and give them opportunity to see the difference. So, practically how does this play out? Here are 3 possible ways\u2026##### 3 things to do when you encounter people with different beliefs\u20261. Don\u2019t freak out\u200a\u2014\u200aYou might stumble over words, your heart might race, you may not know what to say. Take a breath.

Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.\u201d_2. Don\u2019t get on your high moral horse\u200a\u2014\u200aThat means don\u2019t come across as behaving in a haughty, self-righteous, or superior manner. Something might be totally abhorrent, disgusting, evil, immoral and totally not ok. Remember there is no-one without sin.  [_John 8:7_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A7&version=NLT)_\u200a\u2014\u200aThey kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, \u201cAll right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!\u201d_3. Take time to engage\u200a\u2014\u200aTalk, listen, ask questions, be kind, loving, gentle, patient and have self-control. Seek answers to understand first and take time to engage in meaningful conversation and if you have opportunity, give reasons as to why you believe.  [_1 Peter 3:15\u201316_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15-16&version=NLT)_\u200a\u2014\u200aInstead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it. But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ._The Holy Spirit is the one who brings correction, conviction, and changes hearts.

The day of this connection was a little different than most, in that it was ANZAC Day in Australia (similar to Memorial Day in the USA).

Wow, I realised how special that was. He served in WWII, and I had the chance to hear the heart of a man sharing about the very thing you are commemorating.> \u201cDid you enjoy the memorial service?\u201d I was asked by his wife, shortly after I sat down. \u201cEnjoy isn\u2019t a word I would use, I felt like I was at a funeral with a weird twist\u201d, I answered. I could tell Bob appreciated my sentiments and identification.> This was an opportunity to open a very tender subject. This was not the time to brush this question aside but to dive in and discover our very vast, yet strangely very close differences.> I had been impacted firstly by the crowds of people swarming to come, standing on the sand of a local beach, the morning was eery and somber and the sound of the waves coming in was louder by far than any chatter. I imagined the shores lined with soldiers, thousands more had died than the people currently standing there. The shores were not lined with weaponry but with people, families, friends, women, men and children. The waters were not crammed with warships and artillery and the skies were quiet. This beach was not a place wrought with distress, but one of peace and great hope for the future.> I had thought of Bob many times throughout the service. My meeting with him the previous week, had revealed a man who lacked peace through the recurrence of the mass of memories of war that had been surfacing more and more as his age wore on. Hope had been lost.> I did my best to articulate how I felt that morning. I then turned to Bob, and thanked him. I could feel the tears welling in my eyes as I thanked him for his service in the war; that through pain, destruction, grief and many tears he had been a catalyst to bringing hope for our nation. I handed him a box of tissues that I had come armed with. On one side of the box I had written a few words identifying the pain and grief, on another side, \u2018You Brought Freedom\u2019, and on another \u2018Thank You\u2019. On either end of the box, one end said his name, the other said \u2018love Morag\u2019.> Bob is holding a lot inside; for one reason or another he has \u2018clamped\u2019 his story down. On the days he lets a little seep out, he says no-one wants to hear what he has to say. My response to him was\u00a0\u201cI do and I will remember this day for the rest of my life, thank you\u201d> . Bob went on to let more of his story seep out with me. There is hurt, pain, misunderstanding and all sorts whirling around in there.> Bob prayed the other day for the first time in a long time. I say that because I don\u2019t remember if he had said he had never prayed, but he did tell me he hadn\u2019t let God in. He certainly wasn\u2019t in a place to talk to God when I arrived but as conversation progressed and as I allowed him to talk he said he was willing to try.> He simply said\u00a0\u201cJesus help me\u201d> \u00a0followed by\u00a0\u201cGod if you are real, and it matters to me that I know you, can you please show me and open my eyes and my heart to you\u201d.> \u00a0I know God answers prayer, and I will continue to pray for that seed to be watered.> Bob has opened the door, I\u2019ve heard the words from his mouth, I am a witness and although his words following may not reflect a soft heart, God is at\u00a0work.> Bob smiled when I left, he had been annoyed at times throughout the conversation, I had listened, talked, agreed in part, laughed with him and got to know him some more. The anger he feels, he expresses as frustration,\u00a0\u201cwhy has so much happened?\u201d, \u201cwhere has God been in all of this?\u201d, \u201cwhy don\u2019t Christian\u2019s act on what they say they believe?\u201d> \u00a0the list goes on. He just needs time to tell his story, see God at work in his life and the lives of others around him, and hope will continue to creep in.Could you put this story of Bob into an example with one of your own friends or the people you want to share Jesus with?"

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Pray?",
        "body": "Prayer is one of the most powerful things we can do. The Bible talks a lot about prayer, so it\u2019s important we know how to do it. Especially because it is such a core part of living effectively \u2018on mission\u2019.> It\u2019s often overcomplicated, but at face value, prayer is simply just speaking with\u00a0God.How did Jesus pray? When asked, Jesus taught His disciples to pray in a particular way. His prayer is known as \u2018The Lord\u2019s Prayer\u2019 and is the perfect place to start when wanting to know how to pray.> \u201cOur Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.  Your kingdom come, Your will be done,  on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread,  and forgive us our debts,  as we also have forgiven our debtors.  And lead us not into temptation,  but deliver us from evil.[Matthew 6:9\u201313](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9-13&version=AMPC)In this prayer, Jesus gives us a list of key things to do when we pray, let me break down each section\u2026##### Our Father in Heaven, hallowed (Holy) be Your\u00a0name:This reminds us that God is our Father (who lives in Heaven), and we are His children (who live on earth). He loves us very much and is very approachable about any topic, so we need not pray in fear. It also reminds us that God is God and we are not. We right-size God in our minds by contemplating His awesomeness. This helps us remember that He is in control.##### Your Kingdom come, Your will be\u00a0done:This reminds us that our purpose is to see God\u2019s Kingdom expand on the earth. This is essentially praying that people who don\u2019t know God would come to know Him.\u00a0Doing this is extremely healthy, because it also keeps our eyes focused on others and allows God\u2019s love for people to grow in our heart. It also reminds us to surrender our will to Him, and ask God to lead us, rather than leading ourselves##### Give us (today) our daily\u00a0bread:This reminds us to ask for what we need each day and be thankful for the tangible things in life. It can also mean spiritual revelation. If there is something about God or in the Bible that you don\u2019t understand, ask you to make the meaning clear to you.##### Forgive us our debts (wrongs):This reminds us to ask for forgiveness for our wrongs while also reminding us to forgive those who wrong us. We need to forgive others in order for God to forgive us, so forgive them before God in prayer.##### Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from\u00a0evil:This reminds us to ask God to strengthen us as we follow His will. Ask God to help you overcome temptation, break unhealthy life habits and choose His way for our lives. This is also a reminder to pray for God\u2019s protection from the plans of the devil to bring us harm.> Relationship with God is actually an ongoing conversation God. As you practice throughout the day, expect to see God do amazing\u00a0things.##### Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for what you need, but notice how much emphasis God puts on outwardly directed\u00a0prayer.Prayer isn\u2019t just about our needs. Whether it is rightsizing God, listening for His voice to know His will, praying for others to know Him, or to forgive others. It\u2019s so much bigger than our own needs and desires.> Praying for those who don\u2019t know God is so important.We all know people who haven\u2019t yet made a decision to follow Jesus. God wants us to pray for them and encourage them to follow Him, so that their lives can be blessed by friendship with Him.As you pray, you will notice God will increase the love you have for those who don\u2019t yet know Him. Act on this love, and share with them about what God is doing in your life. An opportunity to know Jesus is the best gift you can give to anyone.Salvation is the first step to this exciting journey, and so you can help others embark on this first step in the God journey by sharing about Jesus with them.It starts with prayer."

        "body": "Sometimes first impressions of people and their responses can seem off-putting. A slight pushback, an abrupt, or even a reserved reply can cause us to withdraw, or think that people aren\u2019t interested in talking about anything to do with God.\u00a0I\u2019ve found time and time again that people just need us to stick with them.Here\u2019s a recent story of how I stuck with someone that responded to a FB post and, we started chatting through FB Messenger. I went with that little Holy Spirit nudge to keep reaching out. I\u2019m so glad I did\u00a0\u2026> Dave* was suspicious yet curious enough to say hi. He knew God, he grew up knowing God was there, and knowing about Jesus. God had control of his life, or so he thought...> He didn\u2019t have a Bible and was suspicious of any online Bible links I was trying to send him, so I called a local church and made arrangements so he could collect one from the church office and, then I prayed for him.> Dave wasn\u2019t connected to a church and didn\u2019t want to be. Two weeks went by and, he had not been to collect the Bible; so I reached out again and asked how he was doing.> \u201cI\u2019m not doing good at all\u2026.Just don\u2019t feel safe\u2026.Thank you for your prayers I know God is great he\u2019s always looking out for me but I feel like I sin too much. Why would he still look out for me I\u2019m doing everything wrong, he knows it, I know it sometimes I think this is my choice n I choose to do wrong so I can\u2019t talk to him knowing we both know I choose to do wrong. Now my life is messed up n I\u2019m carrying on right or wrong n I feel like I can\u2019t talk to him to protect me in the wrong things I do\u201d.As we chatted more, I asked if he had ever invited God\u2019s spirit to live inside of him. His answer was\u00a0> \u201cno\u201d.My response:\u00a0> \u201cOh Dave, you will notice so much difference if you tell God you want him living inside of you. He will change and rock your world in a way that you have never known before. When you have the spirit of God living inside of you his truth permeates every part of your being, he guides you, he speaks to you, he directs you, he gives you strength even when you are weak. Do you think you would like to ask God to come into your life, to tell him you are sorry you\u2019ve tried living life without him and ask him to be your boss?\u201dHis answer was\u00a0> \u201cyes\u201d\u00a0and as a result, I lead him in a prayer to do just that.Dave\u2019s comment afterwards was\u00a0> \u201cI felt like my spirit jumped out when saying this prayer n I\u2019m a grown man but for me to cry like that I know this prayer is powerful\u201d.> I started to chat to him about church again, and talk through what would work for him as he\u2019s very shy. As part of the encouragement I then sent him the video \u2018Ransom Note\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200athis is Lecrae\u2019s story.RANSOM NOTE: This link takes you to the video in the yesHEis app from a mobile device\u00a0onlyHis response was\u00a0> \u201cWow my name is Dave n I\u2019ve been ransomed that was inspiring me to go to these groups u talk about\u2026\u2026.Everything Lecrae\u2019s been through is similar to what I\u2019ve been through but more I can relate but he stopped at 19 I just turned 30 n i feel like it\u2019s now or never I been through sooo much in my life too much for any human to handle n I\u2019m still holding on\u201d.> I\u2019m now exploring some options for church with Dave. It\u2019s a whole new journey for him now he\u2019s given God control and asking Jesus to be boss of his life.Be sensitive to pursue conversation a little further. It all started with an offer to pray. I typed out, and spoke out loud what I prayed. When Dave hadn\u2019t done what he said he would do I followed him up, and simply asked a question;\u00a0_\u201care you ok?\u201d.\u00a0_It\u2019s amazing what a simple question can do.Sometimes we can feel like we are spamming our friends, being annoying, or overdoing it.\u00a0Is there someone you need to \u2018stick with\u2019 until the breakthrough comes?"

I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s not the prospect of sharing God that scares me, it\u2019s more so my lack of empathy (_the ability to understand someone else and see life through their eyes_).Lack of good theology and training programs aren\u2019t the things holding many Christians back from sharing their faith, sadly it is simply just a lack of empathy and the right social skills... Yep. I just said that. The key to beating fear is understanding that most people are like the rest of us.> This requires us to stop spending so much time figuring out the right scripts for sharing faith, and start studying the people in our\u00a0culture.How do they think? What matters most to them? What is their learning style? Be familiar with the questions people have about faith and life.We can lack confidence when sharing with strangers (or even friends) because we\u2019re unsure of the outcome if we mention God. While every person and every conversation will unfold differently, the needs of the person rarely change.> Every person is searching for purpose and identity.The challenge is knowing how to address those key needs in a way that will be received well by the person.

        "body": "Sometimes the thought of sharing your faith with someone can feel daunting and it\u2019s hard to know where to start. You\u2019re not alone! I\u2019ve been sharing my faith with people for years, yet I can still have those moments where I feel like I\u2019ve been given a shot of adrenaline, my heart races and my mind suddenly seems to go blank.There can be this urge to run, change the subject or retreat\u200a\u2014\u200abut if I listen to the still voice of the Holy Spirit inside of me, I do exactly the opposite, I lean in and step out. It\u2019s terrifying at times, but then so exhilarating! As Christians, it is a joy to speak life into the lives of those around us so they too may know the hope of Christ that is within us.##### Here are 3 promises which have helped me share my\u00a0faith:01. God is for me ([Romans 8:31)  ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A31&version=NIV)02. I have the life of Christ inside me ([Galatians 2:20)  ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galations+2%3A20&version=NIV)03. The Holy Spirit will help me ([John 14:26\u201327](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A26-27&version=NIV))When talking with friends, sometimes we can be over zealous in enthusiasm to share the truth we know, and our friends can sometimes feel like they are being talked at, rather than talked to, or listened to. Now, I don\u2019t want to curb your enthusiasm, so here are 3 practical tips to help.#### 1. The goal of sharing your faith is to win people, not argumentsThere\u2019s a fantastic scripture in the Bible,\u00a0[1 Peter 3:15\u201317](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15-17&version=NIV)\u200a\u2014\u200a_But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God\u2019s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil._It\u2019s important that we spend time in conversation to understand their journey, viewpoints and experiences. Don\u2019t be offended if your friend is really negative about God, offence breeds contention, and that\u2019s the last thing you need. In a situation like this, a good way to respond would be something like; \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that you feel that way, can you explain why?\u201d Try to read between the lines and listen to what is not being said. You will start to notice areas of pain, distrust, anger, sadness etc, keep them in mind as the conversation continues.God\u2019s loving kindness leads us to repentance ([Romans 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+2%3A4&version=NIV)). Ask God to help you be a carrier of that kindness. Kindness isn\u2019t about agreeing, but it\u2019s speaking truth in love. Be careful not to jump to your own conclusions about why your friends are responding in a particular manner, listen to the Holy Spirit and ask questions. Asking questions is a fabulous way to get understanding, and it helps keep the conversation open and friendly.#### 2. Stay consistent online and\u00a0offlineDiscipleship and evangelism go hand in hand. Our behaviours and our actions disciple people, the question is what sort of discipleship are we presenting? Take a look at\u00a0[Ephesians 5:15\u201320](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A15-20&version=NIV)\u200a\u2014\u200a_Be very careful, then, how you live\u200a\u2014\u200anot as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity._Our lives are being watched both offline and online. The online space can be a great place to have conversation, but it\u2019s also a place where people tend to turn into someone or something else! Social media should not be a place to get on your personal \u2018soap box\u2019 and blast opinions at people. It is a place however where a mirage of thoughts, opinions and lives are shared for all to see.If you do happen to get \u2018blasted\u2019 by a friend because of a post you have shared or you feel to \u2018blast\u2019 someone back, \u2018stop\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200atake a breath and a moment to think and pray first.- Is there more to the story you need to ask first- How can I respond in a loving and kind way?\u2013 Give \u201cbite sized\u201d responses that people can digest- Consider, does this conversation need to happen in a private message or offline?#### 3. Use language which is easily understoodYour friends will understand you better if you use everyday language. Be intentional with your choice of words. Sometimes without thinking we start using words that would only be heard in church or read in the Bible. In conversation, avoid words like; atonement for your sin, blood of the lamb, born again, sanctification, or hedge of protection. The list can go on! I had a funny discussion with some friends the other night about, what does a \u201ctraveling mercy\u201d mean?Whether your conversation is online or offline, always take time to consider how to respond to your friends. Trust that the Holy Spirit will guide you as you speak\u200a\u2014\u200aand of course you\u2019re praying for your friends already right?Being vulnerable as we share our lives with others helps them see we are not some super human, but, just like them, we also struggle. People connect with stories. As much as possible try to share through story telling. Can you relate the situation to a personal experience you\u2019ve had?"

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Hear From God?",
        "body": "I\u2019d love to look into a word I am sure you often hear: \u2018Revelation\u2019. Your Pastors, leaders or friends may speak about receiving a revelation from God. What is a revelation? Is it a sudden idea, a made up story or a secret message?People have revelations every day. Things like:_\u00a0\u201cIt was a revelation to me to learn that my headaches could be cured by drinking more water.\u201d_\u00a0But this is not the sort of revelation I want to explore. I want to look at the question \u2018How do I hear from God?\u2019 and look at the revelations that are important parts of our faith journey. The revelations that help us understand more about God and life.Without revelation, we are like the crowds who followed Jesus aimlessly, applauding the miracles and healing as mere spectators. However, with a revelation, we are like Peter, who knew exactly who Jesus was, and followed Him for that reason, and not just for what He did. Often as Christians, if we are not careful, we can find ourselves chasing the preacher, miming all the right Christian actions and looking for uplifting reactions from those around us rather than chasing God.> _We can be easily consumed with public performance yet neglect private devotion when needing a revelation from\u00a0God._I remember as a Bible College student being consumed with public performance. I was studying full time, while also completing a full time unpaid internship. To survive financially I worked after hours as a freelance graphic designer. I was young and naive, yet up for adventure. It was about being given an opportunity to speak on stage and the praise received after performing well. I recount a day where I was rostered to emcee at a youth service, and at the last minute I was swapped with someone else. I hadn\u2019t slept in days, I had hardly eaten and I was spiritually weary. Something in that decision to take me off the roster really shook me. I remember sitting in a back room, crying out to God asking Him why. In this moment of weakness I realized I had been living out my faith in my own strength and that my identity was in my own ability. It took a small identity crisis to send me to rock bottom, yet it was in that moment that God revealed to me that He is the rock at the bottom. When my identity is found in Him then my strength can also come from Him. That moment of revelation really changed the way I began to live out my faith.The original meaning of the word \u2018revelation\u2019 comes from the late Latin word \u2018Revelare\u2019, a word used to describe that which was \u2018stripped down and laid bare.\u2019 If you look deeper into the word revelation you will notice it is made up of two parts. \u2018Reveal\u2019 and \u2018Ation\u2019. The definition for the verb\u00a0_\u2018reveal\u2019_\u00a0is to unveil and expose. It sounds similar to what we understand a revelation to be (an unveiling or exposure to a part of God), but why use the word \u2018revelation\u2019 and not just use the word \u2018reveal\u2019? It is the suffix (-ation) at the end of the word that makes the difference. The dictionary defines \u2018-ation\u2019 as the result or product of action. So to receive a revelation, it actually requires action on our behalf.> _Revelation requests that we, in private devotion, strip down our identity issues, let go of our insecurities and dispose of grudges and past hurts and lay bare before\u00a0Christ._Like He was, stripped down and laid bare before humanity, the greatest revelation. It is when we are situated like this that we position ourselves in a place to receive revelation\u200a\u2014\u200athe supernatural communication of truth.It took a small roster change to leave me in stripped down position before God. Yet in that moment, I was able to hear from God. These days, the times I hear from God are not circumstantial, they are intentional. They are sacred moments that I cherish because out of my private devotion I have chosen to bow before God and listen.The narrative of grace in the bible is that it is not about what we do for God, but more so what God has done for us. I am not saying that we only receive revelation through our action, it is always through the action of God, but more so that we can position ourselves in the best possible place to receive.\u00a0[Here](http://bjm.org/qa/how-do-i-receive-revelation/)\u00a0is a blog with several other ways you could best position yourself to hear from God.If it has been a while since you have heard from God, why not begin to position yourself in the best possible place to receive."

        "body": "Having moved around to new places and cities where I didn\u2019t know anyone, I have learned, through experience, that the best way to make new friends, is to be a friend. Everyone has a few basic social needs, whether they are a socialite or a wall flower, whether they are just out of school or about to retire. When you take an interest in people, you will arouse their interest.People want to be heard, feel needed loved and feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The difference between an acquaintance and a friend, is how many of these conditions you meet for the other person.The barista at the caf\u00e9 you see every day may feel you need her because she provides a service for you, but unless you listen to her dreams, goals and fears and show understanding and compassion towards her, she will only ever be an acquaintance.It is the same with social media. Have you ever wondered why Facebook affects so many relationships and why people who have never met in person, travel around the world to get married, simply because of an online friendship? It\u2019s because through unguarded and candid communication, people have managed to form solid emotional bonds with another.When we are communicating the love of Jesus to someone online, it is so important to display that love tangibly. We are communicating with lost people and we need to be a genuine friend who listens, loves and accepts.They aren\u2019t a project; they are a person."

        "title": "6 Ways to Arouse Curiosity When Sharing Jesus",
        "body": "I vividly remember the first time I saw someone \u2018evangelising\u2019 on a street corner. I was 10 years old waiting at an intersection with my parents, when an older gentleman stood on a milk crate and began to speak at us about sin.I specifically remember thinking \u201cOh, that is weird, please stop.\u201d Those around waiting with us, didn\u2019t really pay any attention to him at all. I saw a young couple nudge each other, point and giggle but for the majority of the people within ears reach, he did not arouse an ounce of curiosity with his words.Evangelism by definition is the announcement, proclamation and/or preaching the gospel. It is a work of communication in which Christians make themselves a\u00a0_mouthpiece_\u00a0for God\u2019s message of grace and mercy to sinners. So, technically I guess it could be said that the older gentleman was evangelising, although I am unsure if it was a message of grace and mercy.Evangelism is a scary word.\u00a0As a concept and a commission, evangelism is great. However, as an action, the outworking of it over the years has sadly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many.> For us, evangelism is sharing Jesus; and sharing Jesus\u00a0_is just as much about what we do as it is about what we say, and even more so about how we say\u00a0it._If you were to ask a non Christian, what they thought when they heard the term evangelical? They would probably reply something like: \u201cOh, those are the Christians that bait and switch. They\u2019re nice to your face, but they really just want to convert you.\u201d Sadly, there are many people who have been burnt by deceptive evangelism which didn\u2019t care for them as a person as much as it cared for their conversion. Taking interest in the lives and views of others, rather than just trying to \u2018push a message\u2019 always has greater return.Here are 6 ways to arouse curiosity in when sharing Jesus:1. Reclaim the Definition of Christian  To arouse curiosity and engage culture we need to reclaim the definition of \u2018Christian\u2019. We must help people understand that Christians are just \u2018broken people made whole through Jesus\u2019 ([Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:23),\u00a0[2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A17&version=NIV)). We are not an exclusive club of do-gooders or a special interest group. Rather, we are every day people who have come to terms with our brokenness and accepted the grace and mercy of God.2. Model Jesus  The greatest model of faith sharing is the model which Jesus exampled to us. When you read the bible, Jesus and other biblical figures used the power of curiosity. When expected to judge, Jesus wouldn\u2019t. (Check the story of the women caught in adultery in\u00a0[John 8:1\u201311](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A1-11&version=NLT)) He would shock people by being in the unlikeliest of places; when others thought He should be attending to religious matters, He was having dinner with prostitute and thieves ([Matthew 9:9\u201312](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A9-12&version=NIV)). Rather than being on the fringe of community, Jesus was always at the heart of it. There is much to learn from that.> _Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more\u00a0easily._3. Ask Questions  When Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in\u00a0[Matthew 22:15\u201318](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A15-18&version=NLV)\u00a0with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in\u00a0[Mark 10:17\u201318](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-18&version=NLT), or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. It is easy to be an armchair expert and make general statements when it comes to our faith, but too often general statements don\u2019t allow grace for a person\u2019s situation, nor do they create an environment conducive to conversation. Jesus was interested in relationship, so He would ask questions which spoke to a person\u2019s heart. Sometimes, it is a question that gets the wheels turning in a person\u2019s head regarding what they believe to be true.4. Lay the Groundwork  When it comes to sharing your faith, rather than rushing to get a result (decision/conversion), it\u2019s good to lay the groundwork for people to experience discovery, joy and delight in Christ. Create an environment which arouses a curiosity towards your faith rather than an environment which possibly pushes people away from faith (like the man on the milk crate).Psychologists will explain how curiosity is powerful, while marketing departments will prove its power through our happiness to purchase goods. Curiosity is the innovation driving and emotion calming skill that comes naturally to us as kids. It creates an openness to unfamiliar experiences, laying the groundwork for greater opportunities to experience discovery, joy and delight. Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more easily.5. Arouse Spiritual Curiosity  People are more spiritual than we give them credit for, so naturally they begin to become ripe with intrigue when we live out our faith in a way that isn\u2019t condemning. Surprisingly, there are stories of people coming to Christ through a message they heard from a man on a milk crate, yet there are many more stories of people coming to faith because they watched a friend or work mate live out their faith.> _Our aim isn\u2019t to become experts in arousing curiosity, our aim is to become more like\u00a0Christ._Culture tells us \u2018we are all on a spiritual journey and that all journeys are equally valid.\u2019 While this is partly true (all are on a spiritual journey) as Christians we ought be able to show the distinctiveness of Jesus and His incredible saving grace through the way we live.\u00a0Living in a way that arouses curiosity in others does not ignore the fact that people are dead in sin, it just gives us credibility when it comes to the moment of helping people realise that.6. Apologise  It is amazing how far an apology can take you. There have been many unusual things said and done in the name of evangelism and often non Christians can find those a hurdle to accepting Christ. When arousing curiosity, be apologetic for the evangelistic faux pas which have given Jesus a bad name, while also being unapologetic about the truth of the gospel to transform any life and any culture.I am sure there are many other ways to arouse curiosity, but why not start with these. The aim isn\u2019t to become an expert in arousing curiosity, the aim is to become more like Christ.> If becoming like Christ is our \u2018what\u2019, then there is great importance to \u2018how\u2019 we share our\u00a0faith.Remember the words of Jesus in\u00a0[Matthew 10:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A16&version=MSG)\u00a0when He said: \u201cStay alert. This is hazardous work I\u2019m assigning you. You\u2019re going to be like sheep running through a wolf pack, so don\u2019t call attention to yourselves. Be as cunning as a snake, inoffensive as a dove.\u201d"

        "body": "We all face seasons where the busyness of life is so intense that finding time to breath is tricky, let alone finding time to share Jesus. So, the question \u201cHow do I share Jesus in the midst of stress?\u201d is certainly valid!Being a Christian doesn\u2019t make you perfect, or remove you from challenge and stress, rather, your faith gives you an anchor in your stress, and your imperfections are cracks which God can shine hope through. So, it is important to remember that even amidst the busyness, you are a beacon of hope in your workplace, university, or home. Because, sharing Jesus is not only what you say, but how you act, hold yourself and persevere in the hard times.Knowing that shifts the question from \u201cHow do I share Jesus in the midst of stress?\u201d to \u201cWho is my anchor in the midst of stress\u00a0?\u201d Is it yourself, or is it God? If it is God, you\u2019ve picked a winner!> When you know WHO your anchor is, you know HOW to handle stressful situations.Jesus is a great example of this. Throughout the Bible, He always made time to connect and centre His spirit in line with God\u2019s. Even in times we would consider a great stress. A.K.A, the days leading up to the cross! He set aside time to pray and spend with God. He was so connected to the source of life that no matter the chaos and stresses around Him, He had clarity of mind and purpose, which allowed Him to prioritise people. In a crowd of thousands, He was able to identify the lady who touched his cloak in faith and pause, heal and encourage her.If you are like me, you desire to see change in the world, but feel that in the season you are currently in that seems like an impossible task. The truth is, we all go through different seasons, and each come with their own pressures and challenges, yet none of them are void of the need to press into Jesus.> When you are passionate about changing your world, you first need to be consumed with the Holy Spirit changing you. When there is change in your inner life, there will be change in the world around\u00a0you.It\u2019s imperative that you are willing to let the Holy spirit change you from the inside out. If you are not willing to let that change happen in you, how can you expect it to happen in the world around you? It\u2019s a win, win effect. When people see Jesus outworking in you, it\u2019s a beacon of hope which sparks intrigue and becomes the greatest advertisement.> When Jesus transforms you; it changes the way you speak, the way you see the world, the way you interact with the world. No one can argue with a changed life. Self-help cannot do what Jesus can\u00a0do.Let\u2019s be the people who choose to dig into Jesus. People who create change, by ourselves being transformed by Jesus from the inside out. What would it look like if all of us\u200a\u2014\u200afamilies, friends, churches lived from a place of being transformed from the inside out?"

        "title": "Share Jesus Tip: Maximize Your Introversion",
        "body": "Life as an introverted believer can be tricky. You may feel excluded from being part of a conversation, and this can become a recurring excuse to not do the work of the Lord. When small talk exhausts you and strangers intimidate you, how can you be Christ\u2019s catalyst, bringing forth awe in our Creator, through the glorious truth of Scripture?\u00a0> When you struggle with being part of a community, is it justified as a cop-out simply because it is \u201cout-of-your comfort\u00a0zone\u201d?\u00a0> Do we let this God-given personality trait become a stumbling block or a blessing?Even Jesus, during His life here on earth, had introverted moments, withdrawing from crowds to spend time in deep prayer and solitude. Regardless of our nature and temperament, speaking out the Gospel\u200a\u2014\u200athrough words and action\u200a\u2014\u200ais a shared calling. We are urgently called to live outside of our ideal selves because it points to something greater than us. Finding concrete ways to maximize our introversion by highlighting the unique traits of one actually gives us an advantage.##### **Know your strengths, and let God take hold of your weaknesses.**A great skill of an introvert is the heart and patience to listen. It is an act of humility. As theologian and writer, C.S. Lewis, put it,**\u00a0\u201cHumility isn\u2019t thinking less of ourselves, it\u2019s thinking of ourselves less.\u201d\u00a0**Seeking out people and their stories instead of rushing to speak is honorable. By being present, we gain the trust of others who want to be known and heard. By contemplating someone else\u2019s perspective without prejudice, we make way for better understanding and genuine empathy. This type of intimacy broadens relationships for the long haul.Now that we\u2019re on the other side of the spectrum, if you find yourself struggling with eloquence, the story of Moses in Exodus 4:10\u201312 is a powerful reminder that He qualifies whom He calls.> Moses said to the Lord, \u201cPardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.\u201d> The Lord said to him, \u201cWho gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the Lord? Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.\u201dSpeaking His word with all boldness (Acts 4: 29) is possible. There is a time for gentleness and meekness but through sanctification, God\u2019s power can take hold of our fear and apprehension producing in us words of triumph and holiness.##### **Start small.**If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by crowds, fret not. Building relationships for the cause of Eternity is not limited to groups. God can work as faithfully and powerfully through an intentional one-on-one discipleship in the same way He can through an extroverted speaker in front of a crowd of a thousand. Invest in that one person whose relationship with the Lord is more crucial than your preference to be alone. Let purpose be your foundation.As introverts, there will always be that nagging temptation to stay \u201csmall\u201d while limiting ourselves to the familiar, but we all have an integral part in the Commission.\u00a0**God\u2019s evangelistic design to make Him known is both for introverts and extroverts when we realize that because He commands it, He will also qualify us to do the work.**\u00a0Discomfort is temporary while salvation is for eternity."

Especially because it is such a core part of living effectively \u2018on mission\u2019._It\u2019s often overcomplicated, but at face value, prayer is simply just speaking with God._How did Jesus pray? When asked, Jesus taught His disciples to pray in a particular way. His prayer is known as \u2018The Lord\u2019s Prayer\u2019 and is the perfect place to start when wanting to know how to pray.\u201cOur Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.Your kingdom come, Your will be done,on earth as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread,and forgive us our debts,as we also have forgiven our debtors.And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.Matthew 6:9\u201313In this prayer, Jesus gives us a list of key things to do when we pray, let me break down each section\u2026Our Father in Heaven, hallowed (Holy) be Your name:This reminds us that God is our Father (who lives in Heaven), and we are His children (who live on earth). He loves us very much and is very approachable about any topic, so we need not pray in fear. It also reminds us that God is God and we are not. We right-size God in our minds by contemplating His awesomeness. This helps us remember that He is in control.**Your Kingdom come, Your will be done:**This reminds us that our purpose is to see God\u2019s Kingdom expand on the earth. This is essentially praying that people who don\u2019t know God would come to know Him. Doing this is extremely healthy, because it also keeps our eyes focused on others and allows God\u2019s love for people to grow in our heart. It also reminds us to surrender our will to Him, and ask God to lead us, rather than leading ourselves**Give us (today) our daily bread:**This reminds us to ask for what we need each day and be thankful for the tangible things in life. It can also mean spiritual revelation. If there is something about God or in the Bible that you don\u2019t understand, ask you to make the meaning clear to you.**Forgive us our debts (wrongs):**This reminds us to ask for forgiveness for our wrongs while also reminding us to forgive those who wrong us. We need to forgive others in order for God to forgive us, so forgive them before God in prayer.**Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:**This reminds us to ask God to strengthen us as we follow His will. Ask God to help you overcome temptation, break unhealthy life habits and choose His way for our lives. This is also a reminder to pray for God\u2019s protection from the plans of the devil to bring us harm._Relationship with God is actually an ongoing conversation God. As you practice throughout the day, expect to see God do amazing things._**Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for what you need, but notice how much emphasis God puts on outwardly directed prayer.**Prayer isn\u2019t just about our needs. Whether it is rightsizing God, listening for His voice to know His will, praying for others to know Him, or to forgive others. It\u2019s so much bigger than our own needs and desires._Praying for those who don\u2019t know God is so important._We all know people who haven\u2019t yet made a decision to follow Jesus. God wants us to pray for them and encourage them to follow Him, so that their lives can be blessed by friendship with Him.As you pray, you will notice God will increase the love you have for those who don\u2019t yet know Him. Act on this love, and share with them about what God is doing in your life. An opportunity to know Jesus is the best gift you can give to anyone.Salvation is the first step to this exciting journey, and so you can help others embark on this first step in the God journey by sharing about Jesus with them.It starts with prayer."

Whether it\u2019s a crazy story of adventure or a sad tale of heartache, we enjoy listening to them because they grab our attention and take us on a journey. They don\u2019t just convey information, they capture our imagination. They connect with our emotions and leave us wanting more.Jesus was that guy! He was a master storyteller. Thousands would gather to listen to Him; they hung off his every word. He used stories to share the hope in His heart, to conjure deep thought, to challenge mindsets and to change lives. He spoke like a poet, using parable, overstatement, metaphor, sarcasm and dramatic action. Storytelling was His favourite way to communicate and reveal truth.> However, not only did Jesus tell stories full of meaning and purpose, He lived a life full of meaning and\u00a0purpose.He lived in a way which encouraged people to step up while challenging others to step down. He held himself with dexterity which raised intrigue, whilst also flipping tables which raised eyebrows. He extended grace to the sinner, instilling value, whilst challenging the values of the religious. Without doubt, the influence of His stories and His life has had an unparalleled impact on humanity. Multiplied millions have fashioned their lives and beliefs on His words and His life.As followers of Jesus we are empowered to do the same as Jesus. We are empowered to encourage, raise intrigue, extend grace, instil value and show and tell the goodness and power of God. In the book of Acts, before ascending to Heaven, Jesus releases his followers to be power-filled storytellers. He says:\u201cI promise you this\u200a\u2014\u200athe Holy Spirit will come upon you and you will be filled with power. And you will be my messengers to Jerusalem, throughout Judea, the distant provinces\u200a\u2014\u200aeven to the remotest places on earth!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a[Acts 1:8 TPT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A8-10&version=TPT)We can feel confident to tell great stories and live great lives because we have been given the Holy Spirit. Jesus didn\u2019t just show us how to live and then leave us on our own; no, He empowered us. The same power that opened the eyes of the blind and raised the dead has been given to us. The same Holy Spirit which inspired the writings of the Bible and revives the repentant heart lives in us. We can live confident to share Jesus knowing we have the Holy Spirit with us.> After being empowered, we are simply asked to be messengers. To show and tell the goodness and power of\u00a0God.We don\u2019t need to be eloquent preachers with a pulpit or a famous evangelist with a big story. We just need to use our everyday moments as our pulpit to share Christ\u2019s big story. The stories we tell about Jesus and the way we live like Jesus can bring freedom, healing, and hope to others.Generally speaking, over the years, we have been better protectors of the Gospel story than purveyors of it. We have gone in to fight for and protect the Gospel rather than show its power and tell its story. While this has been the way, it doesn\u2019t have to be the way.Consider this a call to tell better stories and live better lives. Not because we are better, rather because we know a God who can change people\u2019s lives for the better. Let\u2019s capture imagination and replace the cringe factor with a curiosity factor. Let\u2019s connect with people\u2019s emotions and have them asking questions rather than asking to leave.Let\u2019s raise our own level of living so we can see people raised to life. Let\u2019s keep telling our God stories so that people can encounter God and have a story of their own."

We often plot the course, prepare our bodies and invest in travel gear but sooner than later, we realize we have less control over the journey let alone the outcome.\u00a0> We realize that pursuing sensible life goals, being physically and mentally fit, building impeccable credibility and having the most reliable connections are no guarantee we make it through the storms of life.\u00a0And when these come, many of us resemble a broken-down wanderer than a confident trailblazer.Disciples are not exempt from the storms of life. Our experience of storms is not dependent on the degree of faith, spiritual maturity or what we do for Jesus. Storms\u2014 spiritual or material in nature, may come in an instant like when my beloved fianc\u00e9 Maur, at the peak of her ministry and a day after our wedding engagement, suffered symptoms of _panic disorder_. These storms will try to move us away from the Christ-centered, Christ-fulfilled life.In Matthew 8, the disciples of Jesus Christ experienced a sudden and violent storm while in the middle of the sea. As if Jesus\u2019 call to a radical life in previous verses was not enough burden, the disciples find themselves thrown around by powerful waves and distressed by howling winds. The disciples are moved towards restlessness, despair, unbelief and resentment even of their Master.\u00a0> Like the disciples, Maur, and I, we tend to focus on the storm and the winds. It can come in waves as what I experience from time to time, being called to minister in church. We look around, listen to the wind and are moved. We are moved by vain thoughts, false teachings, speculations and discouragement.Having been moved from ministry to ministry and now serving as an overseer of a turnaround church, I came to a point in early 2018 when I found myself seeing my peers climbing organizational ladders, building houses, traveling the world, devouring libraries of books and raising families.\u00a0_\u201cAm I still doing what you want me to do?,\u201d_\u00a0I asked God. The response I am still learning is to keep fixing our eyes on Jesus Christ, _the author and perfecter of our faith _(Hebrews 12:2).\u00a0**_Faith reminds us that our life is one with Christ, securely in the hands of God.\u00a0_**Exercising faith involves training our minds and hearts to orient and re-orient towards Jesus Christ. It also takes humility to _not think highly of oneself _(Romans 12:3) and submit to God\u2019s purposes. I thank God that it is when I was led to my present ministry when God gave me the burden for a partner in marriage. God brought Maur and me together. Jesus is looking at our hearts. May he find faith rested in him.Maur and I realized that, like the disciples, we want control over the situation and steer the boat ourselves. When Maur started suffering the terrible effects of panic disorder, we found ourselves striving for control. We wanted to bring back things to the way things were and focus on the wedding preparations. The more we strived for control, the more we sank into confusion and despair. It is Jesus, our anchor, who tells the storm to cease. Jesus desires to put on display his power in our lives. He wants to leave us in awe daily and surrender to Him. When Jesus calls his disciples, he calls them to _come_ to him. Jesus invites us,\u00a0_\u201cCome to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d_ (Matthew 11:28)\u00a0That is surrender.Maur and I surrendered our storm to Jesus. \u201cGod is with us,\u201d became our silent battlecry. From despair, we received peace and hope to fight on and from confusion we received wisdom from people God sent to care for us. God was preparing us not just for the wedding but for married life. Remember, Jesus is with us in the middle of the storms of life. Keep calm and sail on!---Paolo Sanchez"

        "body": "Sharing Jesus with a stranger can feel scary. I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s not the prospect of sharing God that scares me, it\u2019s more so my lack of empathy (_the ability to understand someone else and see life through their eyes_).Lack of good theology and training programs aren\u2019t the things holding many Christians back from sharing their faith, sadly it is simply just a lack of empathy and the right social skills\u2026 Yep. I just said that. The key to beating fear is understanding that most people are like the rest of us.> This requires us to stop spending so much time figuring out the right scripts for sharing faith, and start studying the people in our\u00a0culture.**How do they think? What matters most to them? What is their learning style? Be familiar with the questions people have about faith and life.**We can lack confidence when sharing with strangers (or even friends) because we\u2019re unsure of the outcome if we mention God. While every person and every conversation will unfold differently, the needs of the person rarely change.> Every person is searching for purpose and identity.The challenge is knowing how to address those key needs in a way that will be received well by the person. So, don\u2019t just study the Bible for keys to share your faith, study the people you\u2019re sharing it with. There will be answers for you there too."

        "body": "Having moved around to new places and cities where I didn\u2019t know anyone, I have learned, through experience, that the best way to make new friends, is to be a friend. Everyone has a few basic social needs, whether they are a socialite or a wall flower, whether they are just out of school or about to retire. When you take an interest in people, you will arouse their interest.People want to be heard, feel needed loved and feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The difference between an acquaintance and a friend, is how many of these conditions you meet for the other person.The barista at the caf\u00e9 you see every day may feel you need her because she provides a service for you, but unless you listen to her dreams, goals and fears and show understanding and compassion towards her, she will only ever be an acquaintance.It is the same with social media. Have you ever wondered why Facebook affects so many relationships and why people who have never met in person, travel around the world to get married, simply because of an online friendship? It\u2019s because through unguarded and candid communication, people have managed to form solid emotional bonds with another.When we are communicating the love of Jesus to someone online, it is so important to display that love tangibly. We are communicating with lost people and we need to be a genuine friend who listens, loves and accepts.They aren\u2019t a project; they are a person."

        "title": "6 Ways to Arouse Curiosity When Sharing Jesus",
        "body": "I vividly remember the first time I saw someone \u2018evangelising\u2019 on a street corner. I was 10 years old waiting at an intersection with my parents, when an older gentleman stood on a milk crate and began to speak at us about sin.I specifically remember thinking \u201cOh, that is weird, please stop.\u201d Those around waiting with us, didn\u2019t really pay any attention to him at all. I saw a young couple nudge each other, point and giggle but for the majority of the people within ears reach, he did not arouse an ounce of curiosity with his words.Evangelism by definition is the announcement, proclamation and/or preaching the gospel. It is a work of communication in which Christians make themselves a _mouthpiece_ for God\u2019s message of grace and mercy to sinners. So, technically I guess it could be said that the older gentleman was evangelising, although I am unsure if it was a message of grace and mercy.Evangelism is a scary word.As a concept and a commission, evangelism is great. However, as an action, the outworking of it over the years has sadly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many.> For us, evangelism is sharing Jesus; and sharing Jesus is just as much about what we do as it is about what we say, and even more so about how we say\u00a0it.If you were to ask a non Christian, what they thought when they heard the term evangelical? They would probably reply something like: \u201cOh, those are the Christians that bait and switch. They\u2019re nice to your face, but they really just want to convert you.\u201d Sadly, there are many people who have been burnt by deceptive evangelism which didn\u2019t care for them as a person as much as it cared for their conversion. Taking interest in the lives and views of others, rather than just trying to \u2018push a message\u2019 always has greater return.**Here are 6 ways to arouse curiosity in when sharing Jesus:****1. Reclaim the Definition of Christian **To arouse curiosity and engage culture we need to reclaim the definition of \u2018Christian\u2019. We must help people understand that Christians are just \u2018broken people made whole through Jesus\u2019 ([Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:23), [2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A17&version=NIV)). We are not an exclusive club of do-gooders or a special interest group. Rather, we are every day people who have come to terms with our brokenness and accepted the grace and mercy of God.**2. Model Jesus **The greatest model of faith sharing is the model which Jesus exampled to us. When you read the bible, Jesus and other biblical figures used the power of curiosity. When expected to judge, Jesus wouldn\u2019t. (Check the story of the women caught in adultery in [John 8:1\u201311](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A1-11&version=NLT)) He would shock people by being in the unlikeliest of places; when others thought He should be attending to religious matters, He was having dinner with prostitute and thieves ([Matthew 9:9\u201312](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A9-12&version=NIV)). Rather than being on the fringe of community, Jesus was always at the heart of it. There is much to learn from that.> Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more\u00a0easily.**3. Ask Questions **When Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in [Matthew 22:15\u201318](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A15-18&version=NLV) with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in [Mark 10:17\u201318](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-18&version=NLT), or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. It is easy to be an armchair expert and make general statements when it comes to our faith, but too often general statements don\u2019t allow grace for a person\u2019s situation, nor do they create an environment conducive to conversation. Jesus was interested in relationship, so He would ask questions which spoke to a person\u2019s heart. Sometimes, it is a question that gets the wheels turning in a person\u2019s head regarding what they believe to be true.**4. Lay the Groundwork **When it comes to sharing your faith, rather than rushing to get a result (decision/conversion), it\u2019s good to lay the groundwork for people to experience discovery, joy and delight in Christ. Create an environment which arouses a curiosity towards your faith rather than an environment which possibly pushes people away from faith (like the man on the milk crate).Psychologists will explain how curiosity is powerful, while marketing departments will prove its power through our happiness to purchase goods. Curiosity is the innovation driving and emotion calming skill that comes naturally to us as kids. It creates an openness to unfamiliar experiences, laying the groundwork for greater opportunities to experience discovery, joy and delight. Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more easily.**5. Arouse Spiritual Curiosity **People are more spiritual than we give them credit for, so naturally they begin to become ripe with intrigue when we live out our faith in a way that isn\u2019t condemning. Surprisingly, there are stories of people coming to Christ through a message they heard from a man on a milk crate, yet there are many more stories of people coming to faith because they watched a friend or work mate live out their faith.> Our aim isn\u2019t to become experts in arousing curiosity, our aim is to become more like\u00a0Christ.Culture tells us \u2018we are all on a spiritual journey and that all journeys are equally valid.\u2019 While this is partly true (all are on a spiritual journey) as Christians we ought be able to show the distinctiveness of Jesus and His incredible saving grace through the way we live. Living in a way that arouses curiosity in others does not ignore the fact that people are dead in sin, it just gives us credibility when it comes to the moment of helping people realise that.**6. Apologise **It is amazing how far an apology can take you. There have been many unusual things said and done in the name of evangelism and often non Christians can find those a hurdle to accepting Christ. When arousing curiosity, be apologetic for the evangelistic faux pas which have given Jesus a bad name, while also being unapologetic about the truth of the gospel to transform any life and any culture.I am sure there are many other ways to arouse curiosity, but why not start with these. The aim isn\u2019t to become an expert in arousing curiosity, the aim is to become more like Christ.> If becoming like Christ is our \u2018what\u2019, then there is great importance to \u2018how\u2019 we share our\u00a0faith.Remember the words of Jesus in [Matthew 10:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A16&version=MSG) when He said: \u201cStay alert. This is hazardous work I\u2019m assigning you. You\u2019re going to be like sheep running through a wolf pack, so don\u2019t call attention to yourselves. Be as cunning as a snake, inoffensive as a dove.\u201d"

I had a chance to talk to *Ben recently, and I\u2019d like to take you on a journey of how he got connected to Jesus. He wrote:_\u201cHi I\u2019m Ben, I saw this app and something is telling me to install it. For every years of my life passed, I\u2019ve been trying so hard to stop the works of the devil in my life. I really need Jesus to change my story today, so I don\u2019t get fooled by satan anymore.\u201d_This is an open invitation (and believe it or not, these aren\u2019t uncommon). Ben got stopped by an ad to install our\u00a0[app](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/JSHS), not because he was wanting to share his faith, but because he wanted to know Jesus.> Every single day there are hundreds of thousands of people scrolling and looking for something more\u2026So quite simply, if we continue to put out open invitations for people to engage with content about Jesus, sooner or later someone will stop by for a look! Then the rest of the journey is about helping that person connect to Jesus.My response to Ben was; a friendly hello, direction to a video that could explain what following Jesus meant, and an offer to help answer his questions._\u201cYes I\u2019ve got lots of questions about how to be saved. I\u2019m going to call this app a \u2018Rescue Mission Fellowship\u2019 cause I came in to be rescued that\u2019s all\u201d._I personally find videos to be an amazing way of bringing a visual explanation, and it saves me a\u00a0whole\u00a0lot of typing.\u00a0[Falling Plates](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/4x5X)\u00a0(inside our\u00a0[yesHEis\u00a0](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/JSHS)app) is a fantastic video that speaks powerfully to many people who watch it._\u201cI\u2019ve been a broken plate\u2026that\u2019s how my past was, which is broken to pieces\u2026\u201d_After a short discussion, I asked if Ben would like to make Jesus boss of his life, to which he answered\u00a0_\u201cI\u2019m ready\u201d_. I then typed out something for him to pray out loud to God, right where he was, then boom\u200a\u2014\u200asalvation!With our help, Ben is now connected to a local church. And honestly, that was probably the hardest part of this story. The reason being that;> People are after relationship, they need connection. Without someone there to help, connection can get\u00a0lost.I\u2019ll expand on that a little more. The church were great; they welcomed him, prayed for him, he even filled in a connection card\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, I noticed he had ended up taking it home\u2026With a few gentle questions, he opened up to say he was struggling to connect and felt nervous. Who wouldn\u2019t?! It\u2019s a tough gig getting along to a church by yourself, meeting a whole lot of new people, and in an environment you\u2019re not familiar with.With a quick call to the church and forwarding through his contact details, that was all sorted. He\u2019s now got a Bible to read, a church to attend, and friends to connect with that know Jesus.And it doesn\u2019t stop there. Ben has now shared his story with a colleague.All that started with an ad on a social feed. What video could you share today for someone to find?_*Name changed_"

While we all consume copious amounts of chocolate, statistics suggest that as the chocolate intake increases, so does the interest in Christianity. So then, how do we make the most of the season? Simple, share your own testimony.When you share your own testimony, you are in fact sharing the Easter story.Let us explain, the Easter story is the narrative of Jesus\u2019 death on the cross and His resurrection\u200a\u2014\u200ait is the moment in which death was conquered and we were set free from sin. When we share how Jesus has changed our lives, we are revealing the transformational power of Jesus\u2019s death and resurrection.There is a great example of this in the book of Corinthians in the New Testament. Paul (a man who used to persecute Christians) writes that it is only because of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection that he has been saved. He shares that it is because of Jesus\u2019 death, he has died to his old ways and like Jesus\u2019 resurrection, he has been birthed into this new life. He shares his own story in the context of the Easter story.Maybe our story isn\u2019t as dramatic as Paul\u2019s but just like Paul and millions of other Christians, our own stories are a result of the Easter story.We too can share the power of the Easter story by sharing our own story\u200a\u2014\u200ahere is a simple structure that might help:Your life before JesusHow you met JesusYour life with JesusGo for it and try and use these three simple points to frame how you share your testimony.Remember, when sharing your testimony, we are ultimately directing people to Jesus. Pray beforehand and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you as you share."

        "body": "No one likes awkward conversations. Especially on a plane. Planes have a special way of defining what kind of person you are. I\u2019m cheap, so I usually catch early-morning flights. On early flights, people are usually happy to stay under the radar, read a book, quietly sip a coffee while staring out the window, or just solidly gaze into the back of their eyelids with their mouth open while heavy breathing.Recently I took an early flight with my mate Dan. He quickly locked into the last option. I\u2019d just downloaded Bob Goff\u2019s latest book \u2018[Everybody Always](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Always-Becoming-Setbacks-Difficult/dp/0718078136)\u2019 to my\u00a0_Kindle,_\u00a0so I opened that and nestled in for a quiet \u2018Option 2\u2019.Bob\u2019s book is all about loving everybody, always\u200a\u2014\u200aand this particular chapter was talking about loving our neighbours and encouraging them on the journey of faith. Not just our literal next-door neighbours, but that we actually find neighbours everywhere. In our workplace, our cafes, yoga-classes and, you guessed it, next to us on planes.I quickly glanced at the guy next to me; my current\u00a0_neighbour_. He was probably pushing 60, looked like he\u2019d seen the sun most days of his life and was reading some fiction book about CIA spy missions. Now I\u2019ve got a pretty high threshold for social awkwardness. I don\u2019t usually mind putting myself out there. But, I questioned,\u00a0_\u201cwas I really meant to interrupt this guy? How was I meant to do that? And what if he really was ex-CIA? I wasn\u2019t ready for a painful death.\u201d_> I thought to myself\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cWell, if God\u2019s plan is to use me, then I\u2019m going to put it back on Him to get me in/out of this scenario.\u201d So, that\u2019s what I\u00a0did.I just honestly said_\u00a0\u201cLook Jesus, I don\u2019t really care if I talk to this guy or not, but if you want me to, can you get him to put down his CIA spy manual and talk to me? And also, can he please not kill me in a painful way? k.thanks.bye.\u201d_Then I put my book away and just sat there waiting. 5 mins later he gets a coffee, puts his book down and says, \u201c_So, what do you do for a biscuit?_\u201d\u00a0\u2026Ha!It turned out he wasn\u2019t ex-CIA, he was an awesome guy; a retired teacher. He was visiting his son (who was moving to my city\u2014 another potential neighbour!) and he was super happy and open to chat. As we talked I couldn\u2019t quite see how I was going to steer the conversation \u201cspiritually,\u201d so I just decided to enjoy the conversation and look for an opportunity.The plane was coming down to land, and that opportunity hadn\u2019t come yet. I didn\u2019t want to awkwardly bring \u2018it\u2019 up out of nowhere so, instead I casually pointed out that it was raining outside.My neighbour, let\u2019s call him \u2018old mate\u2019, replied with this\u200a\u2014\u200a_\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny, you can water your garden with the hose as much as you like, but if the same amount of rain falls on it, it just seems to flourish.\u201d_\u00a0There it was! My opportunity! So, I took it!> I simply opened my mouth and shared what I thought about rain from a spiritual perspective._\u201cWell, from my perspective, that\u2019s God. If God created the world, why wouldn\u2019t the rain that he created be the thing that makes it flourish in the best way.\u201d\u00a0_I said.He replied,\u00a0_\u201cYeah I guess. I\u2019m not that religious though. I went to a catholic church when I grew up but haven\u2019t gone back for years.\u201d_I smiled on the inside as I knew I had turned a conversation to God and said:\u00a0_\u201cYeah I grew up in a religious church too. It wasn\u2019t until I started reading the Bible and thinking \u2018If Jesus really existed, if this is really true, this could actually change my life.\u201d_> The conversation went on. It wasn\u2019t awkward. I didn\u2019t Bible bash him. I didn\u2019t lead him in the \u2018sinners prayer\u2019. I simply opened my mouth and shared my thoughts and asked what his\u00a0were.I am a fairly normal guy. I don\u2019t consider myself an evangelist and turning conversations towards God isn\u2019t something I do every day (yet). But, it definitely was exciting to see God throw me an opportunity and it was fun to step up and take it.I took up Jesus\u2019 invitation to join Him in the great co-mission, of restoring humanity to Him. I invited the Holy Spirit to guide me and then obeyed His promptings.I have no idea what \u2018old mate\u2019 is thinking now about our conversation. I\u2019m just praying that the conversation we had was a seed that would grow in some way."

And then there is that moment when you are out at a party and somebody else hasn\u2019t watched that TV show, so you feel it is your right to spend the next 3 hours preaching to them the whole narrative and that they HAVE TO WATCH IT!! (You know you have!)Well, funnily enough, reading the Bible effects us in a similar way. It connects us with Jesus and mobilises us to share His great narrative. In fact, reading the Bible doesn\u2019t give us some sort of empathetic view of Jesus\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a spiritual exercise that connects us with Jesus himself. This is true for all of scripture, both the Old and New Testament.There is a brilliant moment in the book of\u00a0[_John_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A36-40&version=NIV)\u00a0when Jesus is speaking to all sorts of religious and influential figures and has a mic drop moment by stating that He Himself is the fulfilment of scripture! Whilst they have all been looking for eternal life in the pages of scripture, the pages of scripture have been pointing to Jesus the whole time. There is a classic lesson taught in most kids churches and Bible schools, that when we read history\u200a\u2014\u200awe are in fact reading HISstory\u2026(Jesus\u2019 story).##### What does this tell\u00a0us?As we read the great narrative of the Bible\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the story of creation in Genesis right through to the prophetic book of Revelation (even those difficult bits)\u200a\u2014\u200aour relationship with Jesus gets stronger and stronger. To illustrate, reading theBible is like focusing a camera lens, the more we engage with the texts, the more we focus the lens, the more we see and connect with Jesus.##### How do we\u00a0respond?We read and tell. Be encouraged, you do not need a university degree to read the Bible, you do not need to be an expert or certain age to understand what it says. You just need to pick it up (or open the app) and start reading. Set yourself a challenge, try and read the Bible for 5 minutes a day and as the pieces start to come together\u200a\u2014\u200ashare it, use the great narrative of scripture to point people to Jesus."

Beatrice is relatively new to the faith and is passionate about finding videos or articles that affirm her new worldview.It wasn\u2019t long before a friend of hers commented that he didn\u2019t agree with the viewpoint of the video. From there ensued a long yet thankfully civilised discussion about God and suffering.

I could see that Beatrice\u2019s attempts to combat debate topics such as \u201cWhy does God allow suffering?\u201d were clearly not helping her friend understand God or in any way lead him towards a relationship with God, so I thought I\u2019d try a different angle.

Because I believe that God is interested in our everyday\u00a0lives.It is His involvement in my day to day activities that continues to drive my relationship with Him; not the theological and philosophical questions that only confuse and obfuscate.After adding my input, I opened my\u00a0[yesHEis](http://www.yesheis.com/)\u00a0app and searched the video library for videos attached to the keyword \u201csuffer\u201d. There appeared a video about God meeting people in their personal struggles.By sharing the video, I was able to encourage Beatrice to keep sharing her faith, but also engage the curiosity of a non-believer at a heart level, not a head level.Situations like this inspire me to keep growing in my own understanding and relationship with God, enabling me to share more of Him wherever I go."

I often think about what will my brief time here on earth will be measured by.You can find that blog\u00a0[HERE](http://stfi.re/peygba).Often, we have a great desire to implement change in the world, and I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m no exception to the rule. We\u2019re idealistic and have a strong sense of justice. Our dream job often features working in or starting a social enterprise, where we can right the world\u2019s wrongs\u200a\u2014\u200aand get paid for it. Or maybe that\u2019s just me.At the end of the day when all is said and done, and we stand before the Master who gave us life, what will He say? Of our deeds, words, victories and failures\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat will be of noteworthiness to God? Of course the atoning sacrifice of Jesus wipes away the stains of our sin and error.

Did it build God\u2019s Kingdom or our\u00a0own?What about the person we have become? The Bible constantly reminds us to \u2018live worthy of our calling\u2019 so to speak, and the Holy Spirit has been sent as the Helper to grow us into disciples (people who walk and talk like Jesus). In the letter of Jude we know God\u2019s goal is to make us Christ-like, and present us to Himself without fault in that final day ([Jude 1:24](http://stfi.re/zbjnea)).So how can we know this is process is actually taking place in our own lives? Well, we judge a tree by it\u2019s fruit, and the first fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. So in short; if we really know God, the fruit will look like Christ\u2019s love working though us. How can we outwork this great love? One way is by sharing the greatest gift we\u2019ve been given\u200a\u2014\u200athe Good News of Jesus in word and deed.Love is the measuring stick of our lives.

        "title": "FAQ: How Can I Live Out My Faith Well In Today's Social Climate",
        "body": "When we received the question: \u201cHow can I live out my faith well in today\u2019s social climate?\u201d I got excited! As a team, we recently read \u2018Good Faith\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aa great book co-written by\u00a0[David Kinnaman](https://twitter.com/davidkinnaman)\u00a0&\u00a0[Gabe Lyons](https://twitter.com/GabeLyons)\u00a0leaders of Barna and Q. The premise of the book is: \u201c_Being a Christian when society thinks you\u2019re irrelevant and extreme._\u201d Personally, I highly recommend it. The writers delve into socially hot topics using relevant research and experience to offer practical advice on how to live on mission in a heavily \u2018politically correct\u2019 society.They propose that we can effectively live on mission in todays social climate when we combine the perfect mix of\u00a0_how we love_,\u00a0_what we believe_\u00a0and\u00a0_how we live._##### How We Love + What We Believe + How We Live = Good\u00a0FaithSo, to live out our faith well in todays social climate, we need to:- Know what we believe and why.- Align how we love and live with what we believe.- Have conversations which oppose or challenge how we love, what we believe and how we live.Being able to engage in robust discussions with those who may not share the same views as us is important because it helps us examine and build confidence in what it is we believe while also helping others understand.> \u201cBy making room for disagreement, you make space for friendship.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aGood FaithActually, I wonder if we are truly\u00a0_\u2018loving our neighbour_\u2019 and engaging society well if we are only loving those who share the same political views, live in the same areas, enjoy the same music as us, and believe what we believe about God. I wonder if that really is just loving ourselves?> Real relationships are formed when real conversations happen and real relationships are the perfect foundations for conversations about who Jesus\u00a0is.As Christians, we need to remember that by following Jesus we will stand in opposition to culture, because what Jesus taught was countercultural. Our love and our desire to become like Jesus and follow His teachings makes us countercultural and makes us different. It is that difference that allows us to push against the \u2018me centred\u2019 and feelings-based mentalities which control society. Mentalities which are results of miss informed identity. An identity void of Christ. Our faith allows us to showcase a grace filled, selfless view of the world from a strong place of identity and purpose rooted in Christ. It is from this place that we have the greatest opportunity to point people to an encounter with Jesus, no matter the complexity of the current social climate, because we know we are saved (identity) and called (purpose) and we know who we are and whose we are.How we love and how we live ought invite others to also believe what we believe."

        "title": "How I Learnt to Share My Faith Daily - Sarah's Story ",
        "body": "I recently spoke with Sarah, a young woman who shares her faith daily online. 18 months ago she had never lead anyone to Christ, but it\u2019s almost a weekly occurrence.She has gone from being nervous to share anything about Jesus, to someone who takes a conversation about Him in her stride without a second thought.What happened? Here\u2019s what she said:\u201cAt the beginning, sharing your faith can be daunting and fear can stop you from jumping in with boldness. however, like everything, the more you practice the more confident you become. There are many things personally that can hold you back, but when you allow Jesus to work in your life, you can transform this world into His Kingdom.When I first started my journey in sharing my faith it did not go as easily as I thought. But that didn\u2019t stop me. I grew in my confidence by just doing it! I jumped into the deep end and I learnt through action.> The biggest part of me learning to be confident was learning that Jesus always had my back and He was wanting me to give it a\u00a0go.I found the more I leant on trusting the Holy Spirit and His promptings, the more fun and freedom I had. I become more confident to step out into deeper waters. With every hard question or series of harsh words in a conversation, I would remember Jesus\u2019 unconditional love for me which would remind me that Jesus loves this person in the same way.> The more I saw people as Jesus saw them, the less fear took over and the more confident I became in sharing my faith. I knew that people need Jesus as much as I\u00a0do.I always think back to life without Jesus, or a time that I was struggling where I needed Him more than ever. That would remind me there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus for themselves.My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHe must become greater; I must become less\u201d.> When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don\u2019t know\u00a0Jesus.The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus\u2019 love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.Don\u2019t be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It\u2019s has been one of my biggest learning curves but it\u2019s been one of my best.Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\u201d"

        "body": "Are you believing for a spiritual awakening? Are you believing for lives around you to be changed with the truth of the Gospel?Billy Graham was a man who believed that. He is known as the worlds greatest evangelist. It is certainly worth listening to what he had to say about a spiritual awakening and ask the question \u201cwhat can I learn from his life?\u201dSoon after his 99th Birthday in 2017, a video was released (see below) about his entry into his 100th year (Sadly, in February 2018, Billy passed away). Something that Larry King said in the video is worth taking note of. It was the way he recalled spending time with Billy, he said it with with fluency and using his fingers to recount:> \u201cHe answered the questions but it always came back to; Christ is your Saviour. Christ loves you. Christ is with me.\u201dLarry, a man that doesn\u2019t follow God was able to recount 3 things about Billy\u2019s words that in and of themselves are the Gospel.The video gives a fantastic summary, here\u2019s a transcript from \u201cReflections of the Christian Life\u201d, this is what Billy had to say:\u201cI\u2019ve been praying that we might have a spiritual Awakening but I think that becomes possible only as individuals surrender their lives afresh and anew to Christ and live the Christian life wherever you are.First\u00a0we do everything we can to follow in the steps of Jesus.We\u2019re to live a life in which we love one another. We help one another. We live according to what Jesus lived. The Holy Spirit is the one that helps us live that new life style which is one of; love, gentleness and patience, and all of these things that are the fruit of the Spirit.> We must remember that we communicate the gospel by our lives as well as our\u00a0lips.We live before a watching world, a world that is waiting to see if what we say is lived out in our lives. We must be living in the power of the Spirit. We must be men and women that are pure vessels for God\u2019s message.Secondly\u00a0you read His word everyday, the Bible. I know it\u2019s very difficult but you need to start somewhere and I suggest that you start with the gospel of Luke in the New Testament and in the Old Testament with the very first verse. \u201cIn the beginning God..\u201d and study those passages.Make the Bible your source and authority, quote it frequently. Let it\u2019s message be your message. Study it. Meditate on it, trust it\u2019s promises. The Word of God itself has power.Thirdly\u00a0go to your knees and pray until you and God have become intimate friends. I cannot describe to you the joy and the peace that He give to you as a result of that daily routine that you have in prayer.Is there a lack of power in your life?\u00a0Perhaps you have neglected the preparation of your life with neglected prayer. We\u2019ve neglected God\u2019s word and the feeding of our own souls. Whatever it is, confess it, forsake it, repent of it, and then walk in the power of the Holy Spirit and gain victory over it. And may God today lift our vision and may the power of the Gospel break upon our world with fresh force, as we are obedient to Christ\u2019s call to repent and believe the Gospel. Repent and believe the gospel!\u201dWow, what a message! Will you take up the challenge today? Are you willing to be a vessel God uses for a spiritual awakening?##### Here are 3 things to do to take up the challenge\u20261. Ask God to reveal any lack of power in your life  Are you living out what Jesus lived? Ask God today to reveal any area of your life where your words don\u2019t match your actions and put it right \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc2. Make reading your Bible a daily habit  Spend time daily reading the Bible, you don\u2019t leave the house without clothes. Make it your goal not to leave the house without reading your Bible \ud83d\udcd63. Make it your goal to become intimate friends with God\u00a0  Spend time daily talking with God, get to know Him intimately \ud83d\ude03"

Whether it's a crazy story of adventure or a sad tale of heartache, we enjoy listening to them because they grab our attention and take us on a journey. They don't just convey information, they capture our imagination. They connect with our emotions and leave us wanting more.Jesus was that guy! He was a master storyteller. Thousands would gather to listen to Him; they hung off his every word. He used stories to share the hope in His heart, to conjure deep thought, to challenge mindsets and to change lives. He spoke like a poet, using parable, overstatement, metaphor, sarcasm and dramatic action. Storytelling was His favourite way to communicate and reveal truth.> However, not only did Jesus tell stories full of meaning and purpose, He lived a life full of meaning and purpose.He lived in a way which encouraged people to step up while challenging others to step down. He held himself with dexterity which raised intrigue, whilst also flipping tables which raised eyebrows. He extended grace to the sinner, instilling value, whilst challenging the values of the religious. Without doubt, the influence of His stories and His life has had an unparalleled impact on humanity. Multiplied millions have fashioned their lives and beliefs on His words and His life.As followers of Jesus we are empowered to do the same as Jesus. We are empowered to encourage, raise intrigue, extend grace, instil value and show and tell the goodness and power of God. In the book of Acts, before ascending to Heaven, Jesus releases his followers to be power-filled storytellers. He says:> _\"I promise you this\u200a\u2014\u200athe Holy Spirit will come upon you and you will be filled with power. And you will be my messengers to Jerusalem, throughout Judea, the distant provinces\u200a\u2014\u200aeven to the remotest places on earth!\"_\u200a\u2014\u200a**Acts 1:8 TPT**We can feel confident to tell great stories and live great lives because we have been given the Holy Spirit. Jesus didn't just show us how to live and then leave us on our own; no, He empowered us. The same power that opened the eyes of the blind and raised the dead has been given to us. The same Holy Spirit which inspired the writings of the Bible and revives the repentant heart lives in us. We can live confident to share Jesus knowing we have the Holy Spirit with us.> After being empowered, we are simply asked to be messengers. To show and tell the goodness and power of God.We don't need to be eloquent preachers with a pulpit or a famous evangelist with a big story. We just need to use our everyday moments as our pulpit to share Christ's big story. The stories we tell about Jesus and the way we live like Jesus can bring freedom, healing, and hope to others.Generally speaking, over the years, we have been better protectors of the Gospel story than purveyors of it. We have gone in to fight for and protect the Gospel rather than show its power and tell its story. While this has been the way, it doesn't have to be the way.Consider this a call to tell better stories and live better lives. Not because we are better, rather because we know a God who can change people's lives for the better. Let's capture imagination and replace the cringe factor with a curiosity factor. Let's connect with people's emotions and have them asking questions rather than asking to leave.#Let's raise our own level of living so we can see people raised to life. Let's keep telling our God stories so that people can encounter God and have a story of their own.Written by Reuben Skewes"

        "body": "With the world population at 7.5 billion people, and those that identify as Christian at 2.4 billion, there is still much to be done. Thankfully, the opportunities to share Jesus are endless!The Bible has many references, not only to the need for us to share Jesus, but also that people are ready to receive Jesus.\u00a02 Corinthians 6:2 says:\u00a0*Now is the favourable time. Now is the day of salvation,* and Luke 10:2 says:\u00a0*The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few.*# God is already at work on the earth.The Church in China is under persecution, yet continues to see thousands receive Jesus, with a predicted 250 million Christians by 2030. More Iranians have become Christians in the last 20 years than in the previous 13 centuries put together. In Australia and New Zealand, churches are consistently seeing hundreds receive Jesus at regular weekend services. This is not unusual in other countries either.> We repeat, the opportunities to share Jesus are\u00a0endless!There are many ways to share Jesus; from organised to organic and even outrageous. From speaking on the streets, to mission trips, or inviting people to weekend church services. Each of these are effective, however the challenge for each of us is to share Jesus in a way that we find natural, and effective.# Living on mission.At yesHEis, sharing Jesus is part of living on mission. It goes further than random acts of kindness and one off invitations to church (though these are still great). It is about being led by the Holy Spirit daily, acting on His promptings and learning to weave the story of Jesus into people's lives.> When it comes to sharing Jesus, your greatest ability is your availability. Who are you making yourself available for\u00a0today?You don't need to be an eloquent preacher with a pulpit or a famous evangelist with a big story. You just need to use your everyday moments as your pulpit to share Christ's big story. There are opportunities with your next door neighbours, at university or online when you are chatting with friends.# Talking about online opportunities, think about this...If Facebook and Instagram were countries, their combined population would be 2.4 billion. That's larger than China and the USA combined! So if we continue to imagine Facebook and Instagram as countries, perhaps we should be sending missionaries, right?On top of that, studies show that children now spend more time online than watching TV, and adults spend over 10 hours a day connected online. Regardless of whether these stats have a positive or negative impact on society, they certainly show there are more opportunities now than ever before to engage online with the message of Jesus.# Hope, love and life.So, in the face of opportunity, each of us are left with 2 options; to seize it, or to let it go. We invite you to seize the opportunity with us and help bring hope, love and life.Written by Reuben Skewes"

        "body": "Sharing your personal testimony is one of the most natural ways to have a God conversation. It's also one of the most effective ways because your personal experience is harder to dismiss or refute because it happened to you.Let's be honest, everyone loves a good story, and there aren't many better stories than God coming through in a situation. Think back to a time when God answered your prayers or showed you He is real or did something miraculous.It's useful to have God stories like these on hand, so you can use them in a conversation when the opportunity presents itself. A great purpose for your testimony is to create a desire in the hearts of others to say: \"I want that!\"> Focus on what God has done and can do, and do your best to avoid Christianese words.Make sure they understand what you are saying and ask what they think about it. Be sensitive to the signals they are sending that indicate their interest. It is vitally important for you to pick up on those signals, so you can follow up with relevant questions and go deeper in conversation.# Remember: The story of what God has done in your life is key to others experiencing Him too.Written by Judah Kampkes"

I had a chance to talk to *Ben recently, and I'd like to take you on a journey of how he got connected to Jesus. He wrote:_\"Hi I'm Ben, I saw this app and something is telling me to install it. For every years of my life passed, I've been trying so hard to stop the works of the devil in my life. I really need Jesus to change my story today, so I don't get fooled by satan anymore.\"_This is an open invitation (and believe it or not, these aren't uncommon). Ben got stopped by an ad to install our\u00a0app, not because he was wanting to share his faith, but because he wanted to know Jesus.> Every single day there are hundreds of thousands of people scrolling and looking for something more...So quite simply, if we continue to put out open invitations for people to engage with content about Jesus, sooner or later someone will stop by for a look! Then the rest of the journey is about helping that person connect to Jesus.My response to Ben was; a friendly hello, direction to a video that could explain what following Jesus meant, and an offer to help answer his questions._\"Yes I've got lots of questions about how to be saved. I'm going to call this app a 'Rescue Mission Fellowship' cause I came in to be rescued that's all.\"_I personally find videos to be an amazing way of bringing a visual explanation, and it saves me a\u00a0whole\u00a0lot of typing.\u00a0Falling Plates (inside our yesHEis app) is a fantastic video that speaks powerfully to many people who watch it._\"I've been a broken plate...that's how my past was, which is broken to pieces...\"_After a short discussion, I asked if Ben would like to make Jesus boss of his life, to which he answered\u00a0_\"I'm ready\"_. I then typed out something for him to pray out loud to God, right where he was, then boom\u200a\u2014\u200asalvation!With our help, Ben is now connected to a local church. And honestly, that was probably the hardest part of this story. The reason being that;> People are after relationship, they need connection. Without someone there to help, connection can get\u00a0lost.I'll expand on that a little more. The church were great; they welcomed him, prayed for him, he even filled in a connection card\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, I noticed he had ended up taking it home...With a few gentle questions, he opened up to say he was struggling to connect and felt nervous. Who wouldn't?! It's a tough gig getting along to a church by yourself, meeting a whole lot of new people, and in an environment you're not familiar with.With a quick call to the church and forwarding through his contact details, that was all sorted. He's now got a Bible to read, a church to attend, and friends to connect with that know Jesus.And it doesn't stop there. Ben has now shared his story with a colleague.# All that started with an ad on a social feed. What video could you share today for someone to find?Written by Morag Paton_*Name changed_"

        "body": "## What is\u00a0Love?Perhaps the most enduring question humanity has ever asked is 'What is love?'. Throughout history, from William Shakespeare to Justin Bieber, the pursuit of the greatest expression of love has been written on our hearts.In modern culture, the pursuit of romantic love is glamorised as the pinnacle of human endeavour. Yet, once it has been attained, it seldom solves our deepest needs\u200a\u2014this is why there are as many love songs as there are heartbreak songs. So what are we missing? Is there something more? What is true love?In\u00a0John 15:13, Jesus gives us a clear and succinct answer:\u00a0_\"For the greatest love of all is a love that sacrifices all. And this great love is demonstrated when a person sacrifices his life for his friends.\"_Jesus puts himself on the line as an example and pattern for us to follow. True love is not measured by a feeling that we 'get', rather it is measured by how much of ourselves that we 'give'. True love is sacrifice.A mother's love for her unborn baby, a single Dad working multiple jobs to look after his son, a teenager sacrificing his wage for his sick Mum, or an elderly couple who have weathered the storms of life together. These are all beautiful examples of sacrifice\u200a\u2014\u200aand are mere shadows of the fullness of Jesus' love for us which was displayed by His sacrificial death on the cross.## Cross Equals\u00a0Love**This Easter, as the story of the cross gets thrown front and centre in our culture, let's take this unique opportunity to share about Jesus and His love for humanity.**We've tailor-made a video that you can share this Easter to start this conversation with a friend.

While we all consume copious amounts of chocolate, statistics suggest that as the chocolate intake increases, so does the interest in Christianity. So then, how do we make the most of the season? Simple, share your own testimony.> When you share your own testimony, you are in fact sharing the Easter\u00a0story.Let us explain, the Easter story is the narrative of Jesus\u2019 death on the cross and His resurrection\u200a\u2014\u200ait is the moment in which death was conquered and we were set free from sin. When we share how Jesus has changed our lives, we are revealing the transformational power of Jesus\u2019s death and resurrection.There is a great example of this in the book of\u00a0[Corinthians](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A1-11&version=NIV)\u00a0in the New Testament. Paul (a man who used to persecute Christians) writes that it is only\u00a0because of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection that he has been saved. He shares that it is because of Jesus\u2019 death, he has died to his old ways and like Jesus\u2019 resurrection, he has been birthed into this new life. He shares his own story in the context of the Easter story.Maybe our story isn\u2019t as dramatic as Paul\u2019s but just like Paul and millions of other Christians, our own stories are a result of the Easter story.We too can share the power of the Easter story by sharing our own story\u200a\u2014\u200ahere is a simple structure that might help:1. Your life before Jesus2. How you met Jesus3. Your life with JesusGo for it and try and use these three simple points to frame how you share your testimony.Remember, when sharing your testimony, we are ultimately directing people to Jesus.

        "title": "Tim\u2019s Story \u2014 Sharing Jesus with a Stranger on a Plane",
        "body": "No one likes awkward conversations. Especially on a plane. Planes have a special way of defining what kind of person you are. I'm cheap, so I usually catch early-morning flights. On early flights, people are usually happy to stay under the radar, read a book, quietly sip a coffee while staring out the window, or just solidly gaze into the back of their eyelids with their mouth open while heavy breathing.Recently I took an early flight with my mate Dan. He quickly locked into the last option. I'd just downloaded Bob Goff's latest book 'Everybody Always' to my\u00a0*Kindle,*\u00a0so I opened that and nestled in for a quiet 'Option 2'.Bob's book is all about loving everybody, always\u200a\u2014\u200aand this particular chapter was talking about loving our neighbours and encouraging them on the journey of faith. Not just our literal next-door neighbours, but that we actually find neighbours everywhere. In our workplace, our cafes, yoga-classes and, you guessed it, next to us on planes.I quickly glanced at the guy next to me; my current\u00a0_neighbour_. He was probably pushing 60, looked like he'd seen the sun most days of his life and was reading some fiction book about CIA spy missions. Now I've got a pretty high threshold for social awkwardness. I don't usually mind putting myself out there. But, I questioned,\u00a0_\"was I really meant to interrupt this guy? How was I meant to do that? And what if he really was ex-CIA? I wasn't ready for a painful death.\"_> I thought to myself\u200a\u2014\u200a_\"Well, if God's plan is to use me, then I'm going to put it back on Him to get me in/out of this scenario.\"_ So, that's what I\u00a0did.I just honestly said _\"Look Jesus, I don't really care if I talk to this guy or not, but if you want me to, can you get him to put down his CIA spy manual and talk to me? And also, can he please not kill me in a painful way? k.thanks.bye.\"_Then I put my book away and just sat there waiting. 5 mins later he gets a coffee, puts his book down and says, _\"So, what do you do for a biscuit?\"_\u00a0...Ha!It turned out he wasn't ex-CIA, he was an awesome guy; a retired teacher. He was visiting his son (who was moving to my city \u2014 another potential neighbour!) and he was super happy and open to chat. As we talked I couldn't quite see how I was going to steer the conversation \"spiritually\", so I just decided to enjoy the conversation and look for an opportunity.The plane was coming down to land, and that opportunity hadn't come yet. I didn't want to awkwardly bring 'it' up out of nowhere so, instead I casually pointed out that it was raining outside.My neighbour, let's call him 'old mate', replied with this\u200a\u2014\u200a_\"Isn't it funny, you can water your garden with the hose as much as you like, but if the same amount of rain falls on it, it just seems to flourish.\"_\u00a0There it was! My opportunity! So, I took it!> I simply opened my mouth and shared what I thought about rain from a spiritual perspective._\"Well, from my perspective, that's God. If God created the world, why wouldn't the rain that he created be the thing that makes it flourish in the best way.\"_\u00a0I said.He replied,\u00a0_\"Yeah I guess. I'm not that religious though. I went to a Catholic church when I grew up but haven't gone back for years.\"_I smiled on the inside as I knew I had turned a conversation to God and said:\u00a0_\"Yeah I grew up in a religious church too. It wasn't until I started reading the Bible and thinking 'If Jesus really existed, if this is really true, this could actually change my life.'\"_> The conversation went on. It wasn't awkward. I didn't Bible bash him. I didn't lead him in the 'sinners prayer'. I simply opened my mouth and shared my thoughts and asked what his\u00a0were.I am a fairly normal guy. I don't consider myself an evangelist and turning conversations towards God isn't something I do every day (yet). But, it definitely was exciting to see God throw me an opportunity and it was fun to step up and take it.I took up Jesus' invitation to join Him in the great co-mission, of restoring humanity to Him. I invited the Holy Spirit to guide me and then obeyed His promptings.I have no idea what 'old mate' is thinking now about our conversation. I'm just praying that the conversation we had was a seed that would grow in some way.Written by Tim Doecke"

(You know you have!)Well, funnily enough, reading the Bible effects us in a similar way. It connects us with Jesus and mobilises us to share His great narrative. In fact, reading the Bible doesn't give us some sort of empathetic view of Jesus\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a spiritual exercise that connects us with Jesus himself. This is true for all of scripture, both the Old and New Testament.There is a brilliant moment in the book of\u00a0John\u00a0when Jesus is speaking to all sorts of religious and influential figures and has a mic drop moment by stating that He Himself is the fulfilment of scripture! Whilst they have all been looking for eternal life in the pages of scripture, the pages of scripture have been pointing to Jesus the whole time. There is a classic lesson taught in most kids churches and Bible schools, that when we read history\u200a---\u200awe are in fact reading HISstory...(Jesus' story).## What does this tell\u00a0us?As we read the great narrative of the Bible\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the story of creation in Genesis right through to the prophetic book of Revelation (even those difficult bits)\u200a\u2014\u200aour relationship with Jesus gets stronger and stronger. To illustrate, reading theBible is like focusing a camera lens, the more we engage with the texts, the more we focus the lens, the more we see and connect with Jesus.## How do we\u00a0respond?We read and tell. Be encouraged, you do not need a university degree to read the Bible, you do not need to be an expert or certain age to understand what it says. You just need to pick it up (or open the app) and start reading. Set yourself a challenge, try and read the Bible for 5 minutes a day and as the pieces start to come together\u200a\u2014\u200ashare it, use the great narrative of scripture to point people to Jesus.Written by James Stinson"

Beatrice is relatively new to the faith and is passionate about finding videos or articles that affirm her new worldview.It wasn't long before a friend of hers commented that he didn't agree with the viewpoint of the video. From there ensued a long yet thankfully civilised discussion about God and suffering. The friend even brought out the famous Stephen Fry video where Fry states that he would ask God why He created bugs that cause blindness.I watched the Facebook conversation deteriorate further with every complex question that was raised. I could see that Beatrice's attempts to combat debate topics such as \"Why does God allow suffering?\" were clearly not helping her friend understand God or in any way lead him towards a relationship with God, so I thought I'd try a different angle. I decided to chime in with my personal story instead.> Why make it personal? Because I believe that God is interested in our everyday\u00a0lives.It is His involvement in my day to day activities that continues to drive my relationship with Him; not the theological and philosophical questions that only confuse and obfuscate.After adding my input, I opened my\u00a0yesHEis\u00a0app and searched the video library for videos attached to the keyword \"suffer\". There appeared a video about God meeting people in their personal struggles.By sharing the video, I was able to encourage Beatrice to keep sharing her faith, but also engage the curiosity of a non-believer at a heart level, not a head level.Situations like this inspire me to keep growing in my own understanding and relationship with God, enabling me to share more of Him wherever I go.Written by Bonar Tanudjaja"

A slight pushback, an abrupt, or even a reserved reply can cause us to withdraw, or think that people aren't interested in talking about anything to do with God.\u00a0**I've found time and time again that people just need us to stick with them.**Here's a recent story of how I stuck with someone that responded to a FB post and, we started chatting through FB Messenger. I went with that little Holy Spirit nudge to keep reaching out. I'm so glad I did\u00a0...> Dave* was suspicious yet curious enough to say hi. He knew God, he grew up knowing God was there, and knowing about Jesus. God had control of his life, or so he thought...> He didn't have a Bible and was suspicious of any online Bible links I was trying to send him, so I called a local church and made arrangements so he could collect one from the church office and, then I prayed for him.> Dave wasn't connected to a church and didn't want to be. Two weeks went by and, he had not been to collect the Bible; so I reached out again and asked how he was doing.> _\"I'm not doing good at all....Just don't feel safe....Thank you for your prayers I know God is great he's always looking out for me but I feel like I sin too much. Why would he still look out for me I'm doing everything wrong, he knows it, I know it sometimes I think this is my choice n I choose to do wrong so I can't talk to him knowing we both know I choose to do wrong. Now my life is messed up n I'm carrying on right or wrong n I feel like I can't talk to him to protect me in the wrong things I do\"._> As we chatted more, I asked if he had ever invited God's spirit to live inside of him. His answer was\u00a0_\"no\"_.> My response:\u00a0_\"Oh Dave, you will notice so much difference if you tell God you want him living inside of you. He will change and rock your world in a way that you have never known before. When you have the spirit of God living inside of you his truth permeates every part of your being, he guides you, he speaks to you, he directs you, he gives you strength even when you are weak. Do you think you would like to ask God to come into your life, to tell him you are sorry you've tried living life without him and ask him to be your boss?\"_> His answer was\u00a0_\"yes\"_\u00a0and as a result, I lead him in a prayer to do just that.> Dave's comment afterwards was\u00a0_\"I felt like my spirit jumped out when saying this prayer n I'm a grown man but for me to cry like that I know this prayer is powerful\"._> I started to chat to him about church again, and talk through what would work for him as he's very shy. As part of the encouragement I then sent him the video 'Ransom Note'\u200a\u2014\u200athis is Lecrae's story.> His response was\u00a0_\"Wow my name is Dave n I've been ransomed that was inspiring me to go to these groups u talk about.......Everything Lecrae's been through is similar to what I've been through but more I can relate but he stopped at 19 I just turned 30 n i feel like it's now or never I been through sooo much in my life too much for any human to handle n I'm still holding on\"._> I'm now exploring some options for church with Dave. It's a whole new journey for him now he's given God control and asking Jesus to be boss of his life.Be sensitive to pursue conversation a little further. It all started with an offer to pray. I typed out, and spoke out loud what I prayed. When Dave hadn't done what he said he would do I followed him up, and simply asked a question;\u00a0_\"are you ok?\"_. It's amazing what a simple question can do.Sometimes we can feel like we are spamming our friends, being annoying, or overdoing it.\u00a0**Is there someone you need to 'stick with' until the breakthrough comes?**Written by Morag Paton"

I often think about what will my brief time here on earth will be measured by.Often, we have a great desire to implement change in the world, and I'm aware that I'm no exception to the rule. We're idealistic and have a strong sense of justice. Our dream job often features working in or starting a social enterprise, where we can right the world's wrongs\u200a\u2014\u200aand get paid for it. Or maybe that's just me.At the end of the day when all is said and done, and we stand before the Master who gave us life, what will He say? Of our deeds, words, victories and failures\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat will be of noteworthiness to God? Of course the atoning sacrifice of Jesus wipes away the stains of our sin and error. So there's no condemnation here.## My question is what is left standing after this cleansing, and what will be its eternal significance? Did it build God's Kingdom or our\u00a0own?What about the person we have become? The Bible constantly reminds us to 'live worthy of our calling' so to speak, and the Holy Spirit has been sent as the Helper to grow us into disciples (people who walk and talk like Jesus). In the letter of Jude we know God's goal is to make us Christ-like, and present us to Himself without fault in that final day (Jude 1:24).So how can we know this is process is actually taking place in our own lives? Well, we judge a tree by it's fruit, and the first fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. So in short; if we really know God, the fruit will look like Christ's love working though us. How can we outwork this great love? One way is by sharing the greatest gift we've been given\u200a\u2014 the Good News of Jesus in word and deed.Love is the measuring stick of our lives.

As a team, we recently read 'Good Faith'\u200a\u2014\u200aa great book co-written by\u00a0David Kinnaman &\u00a0Gabe Lyons leaders of Barna and Q. The premise of the book is: _\"Being a Christian when society thinks you're irrelevant and extreme.\"_ Personally, I highly recommend it. The writers delve into socially hot topics using relevant research and experience to offer practical advice on how to live on mission in a heavily 'politically correct' society.They propose that we can effectively live on mission in todays social climate when we combine the perfect mix of\u00a0*how we love*,\u00a0*what we believe*\u00a0and\u00a0*how we live.*## How We Love + What We Believe + How We Live = Good\u00a0FaithSo, to live out our faith well in todays social climate, we need to:- Know what we believe and why.- Align how we love and live with what we believe.- Have conversations which oppose or challenge how we love, what we believe and how we live.Being able to engage in robust discussions with those who may not share the same views as us is important because it helps us examine and build confidence in what it is we believe while also helping others understand.> _\"By making room for disagreement, you make space for friendship.\"_\u200a\u2014\u200aGood FaithActually, I wonder if we are truly\u00a0_'loving our neighbour'_ and engaging society well if we are only loving those who share the same political views, live in the same areas, enjoy the same music as us, and believe what we believe about God. I wonder if that really is just loving ourselves?> Real relationships are formed when real conversations happen and real relationships are the perfect foundations for conversations about who Jesus\u00a0is.As Christians, we need to remember that by following Jesus we will stand in opposition to culture, because what Jesus taught was countercultural. Our love and our desire to become like Jesus and follow His teachings makes us countercultural and makes us different. It is that difference that allows us to push against the 'me centred' and feelings-based mentalities which control society. Mentalities which are results of miss informed identity. An identity void of Christ. Our faith allows us to showcase a grace filled, selfless view of the world from a strong place of identity and purpose rooted in Christ. It is from this place that we have the greatest opportunity to point people to an encounter with Jesus, no matter the complexity of the current social climate, because we know we are saved (identity) and called (purpose) and we know who we are and whose we are.# How we love and how we live ought invite others to also believe what we believe.Written by Tara Brown"

        "body": "I recently spoke with Sarah, a young woman who shares her faith daily online. 18 months ago she had never lead anyone to Christ, but it's almost a weekly occurrence.She has gone from being nervous to share anything about Jesus, to someone who takes a conversation about Him in her stride without a second thought.**What happened? Here's what she said:**_\"At the beginning, sharing your faith can be daunting and fear can stop you from jumping in with boldness. however, like everything, the more you practice the more confident you become. There are many things personally that can hold you back, but when you allow Jesus to work in your life, you can transform this world into His Kingdom.__When I first started my journey in sharing my faith it did not go as easily as I thought. But that didn't stop me. I grew in my confidence by just doing it! I jumped into the deep end and I learnt through action._> _The biggest part of me learning to be confident was learning that Jesus always had my back and He was wanting me to give it a\u00a0go.__I found the more I leant on trusting the Holy Spirit and His promptings, the more fun and freedom I had. I become more confident to step out into deeper waters. With every hard question or series of harsh words in a conversation, I would remember Jesus' unconditional love for me which would remind me that Jesus loves this person in the same way._> _The more I saw people as Jesus saw them, the less fear took over and the more confident I became in sharing my faith. I knew that people need Jesus as much as I\u00a0do.__I always think back to life without Jesus, or a time that I was struggling where I needed Him more than ever. That would remind me there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus for themselves.__My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014\u200a\"He must become greater; I must become less\"._> _When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don't know\u00a0Jesus.__The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus' love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.__Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.__Don't be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It's has been one of my biggest learning curves but it's been one of my best.__**Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\"**_Written by Morag Paton"

He is known as the worlds greatest evangelist. It is certainly worth listening to what he had to say about a spiritual awakening and ask the question \"what can I learn from his life?\"Soon after his 99th Birthday in 2017, a video was released about his entry into his 100th year (Sadly, in February 2018, Billy passed away). Something that Larry King said in the video is worth taking note of. It was the way he recalled spending time with Billy, he said it with with fluency and using his fingers to recount:> _\"He answered the questions but it always came back to; Christ is your Saviour. Christ loves you. Christ is with me.\"_Larry, a man that doesn't follow God was able to recount 3 things about Billy's words that in and of themselves are the Gospel.The video gives a fantastic summary, here's a transcript from \"Reflections of the Christian Life\", this is what Billy had to say:_\"I've been praying that we might have a spiritual Awakening but I think that becomes possible only as individuals surrender their lives afresh and anew to Christ and live the Christian life wherever you are.__**First**\u00a0we do everything we can to follow in the steps of Jesus.__We're to live a life in which we love one another. We help one another. We live according to what Jesus lived. The Holy Spirit is the one that helps us live that new life style which is one of; love, gentleness and patience, and all of these things that are the fruit of the Spirit._> _We must remember that we communicate the gospel by our lives as well as our\u00a0lips.__We live before a watching world, a world that is waiting to see if what we say is lived out in our lives. We must be living in the power of the Spirit. We must be men and women that are pure vessels for God's message.__**Secondly**\u00a0you read His word everyday, the Bible. I know it's very difficult but you need to start somewhere and I suggest that you start with the gospel of Luke in the New Testament and in the Old Testament with the very first verse. \"In the beginning God..\" and study those passages.__Make the Bible your source and authority, quote it frequently. Let it's message be your message. Study it. Meditate on it, trust it's promises. The Word of God itself has power.__**Thirdly**\u00a0go to your knees and pray until you and God have become intimate friends. I cannot describe to you the joy and the peace that He give to you as a result of that daily routine that you have in prayer.__**Is there a lack of power in your life?**\u00a0Perhaps you have neglected the preparation of your life with neglected prayer. We've neglected God's word and the feeding of our own souls. Whatever it is, confess it, forsake it, repent of it, and then walk in the power of the Holy Spirit and gain victory over it. And may God today lift our vision and may the power of the Gospel break upon our world with fresh force, as we are obedient to Christ's call to repent and believe the Gospel. Repent and believe the gospel!\"_Wow, what a message! Will you take up the challenge today? Are you willing to be a vessel God uses for a spiritual awakening?## Here are 3 things to do to take up the challenge...1. Ask God to reveal any lack of power in your life\\> Are you living out what Jesus lived? Ask God today to reveal any area of your life where your words don't match your actions and put it right \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc2.

Both clearly living risky lives, they have a candid conversation about what it means to have faith when all we want is safety and control.From flying in planes to talking on the telephone, faith is something that as humans, we exercise almost every minute of every day of our lives. We regularly put our faith in things that we don't understand and that are completely out of our control.Tom makes the point that faith is only as ridiculous as what it is that you're putting your faith IN. Referring to faith in Jesus, he makes the comment:> _\"It's only crazy if what you trust in is weak. Creating the universe... coming back to life... if that's legit, he must be awesome.\"_This quirky animation is a great conversation starter to encourage a friend that having faith in God is not something abnormal or outside the realm of possibility for them.

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Simply Explain The Gospel?",
        "body": "'The Gospel' is a phrase thrown around often in Christian circles. To explain the Gospel, it is important to understand what it is. Let's unpack it quickly...The word 'Gospel' literally means 'Good News' and it is mentioned 90+ times in the Bible. Broadly speaking, 'The Gospel' is the whole of scripture; the mega narrative of God's plan to restore humanity to himself.> Specifically speaking, 'The Gospel' is the good news about Jesus. The story of\u00a0*who\u00a0*He is and\u00a0*what\u00a0*He\u00a0did.# Let's break it down so you know how to explain it in 3 simple\u00a0steps...## 1. God's\u00a0DesignGod created the world. We can see beauty, purpose and evidence of design all around us. It is impossible to ignore. Just look the intricate design of plants, the way the moon influences the tide, or the ever changing colours in a sunset. The Bible tells us that God originally designed a world that worked perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200awhere everything and everyone fit together in harmony. God created us for a purpose. He created us to know Him and to enjoy Him; to live and bring glory and honour to Him._Read: Genesis 1:31,\u00a0Psalm 19:1\u00a0&\u00a0Ephesians 2:10_## 2. Our Brokenness (Sin)If we look around at society, it is easy to see that humanity is not bringing glory to God. Rather there is a brokenness in the world. We see it in the evil of terrorism, we see it in war, violence, abuse, deceit and betrayal. In ignorance to God, we could search high and low for the reason of the brokenness, but the truth is, beneath it all, the problem is spiritual. Really, we are the problem. We have not lived for God, we have not followed His rules, rather we have made our own. We have not valued a relationship with Him. The Bible calls this sin. Sin is running from God, trying to do life our own way. Sin is taking the title of God and putting it upon ourselves. It is because of sin that we as humanity have become hostile, not only towards God, but towards others. The Bible says the consequence of sin is death._Read: Romans 1:25,\u00a0Romans 3:23,\u00a0Romans 6:23\u00a0&\u00a0Proverbs 14:12## 3. The Solution\u00a0(Jesus)Brokenness leads to a place of realising a need for help; a remedy, some Good News. God, because of His mercy and great love for us, did not leave us in our brokenness. He sent His Son, Jesus as a solution to our sin problem. Jesus, came to us, lived a perfect sin-free life (exampling life by God's design) and willingly chose to die in our place to pay the penalty for our sin. He then defeated death and rose to life. He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Simply hearing this good news is not enough, we must act on it and admit to our sinful brokenness, ask God for forgiveness and stop trusting in ourselves. This is when we can begin to understand God's original design for our lives and the lives of others._Read:\u00a0John 3:16,\u00a0Colossians 2:14,\u00a0Mark 1:15\u00a0&\u00a0Ephesians 2:8\u20149There you go! A simple (but not too simple that you have to re-explain it) version of the Gospel. Remembering the 3 stages and the key parts of each stage will help you feel confident to share the Gospel at any moment.# Why not try explaining the Gospel today?Written by Reuben Skewes"

She has led many people in the decision to make Jesus their boss, and has prompted many others to take time to explore God more for themselves.I asked Tish to write down a few thoughts from her experiences. You might be surprised to hear what she shares.I'll let her tell the story..._\"When I first started chatting to people online I found it really confronting because I got to see the words I was choosing to use. I was shocked at how harsh I was, and at times, I was down right weird! I would read back over the conversation and realise how much of what I was saying was actually distracting the person. To make things worse I noticed that I wasn't being a good listener\u200a---\u200apeople were opening up and sharing their experiences but instead of acknowledging them, I bull-dozed along with a goal in mind._> _I think somewhere in my head I thought if I just got them to say a salvation prayer I had done my\u00a0job.__This kind of mentality is dangerous and ineffective. It skips past the part where God is wanting to form a personal relationship with the person. I needed to keep it simple\u200a\u2014\u200amy job was to introduce people to Jesus. After a while, I found I had improved, and talking with people online wasn't such a hard thing. It got me thinking about the way I spoke though; was I any different when chatting to people face-to-face?__I'm not sure I've figured out the answer to that question yet, I think it's a work in progress. I know our words don't have to be fancy and sound spiritual to make an impact. I know people need to know they can be themselves in front of God and just be real with Him._> _I've learnt to listen more and I have become less 'preachy' and more relational. People aren't searching for religion, they are searching for relationship.\"_Whether you are interacting with someone online or face to face; when we are genuine and honest, simple and not fancy, quick to listen and slow to get to the end, we can make a real difference in peoples lives.Why not try out your skills and strike up a conversation with someone online? See how you go with keeping things simple. Allow yourself to read over what you shared and see if God is revealing anything to you about how you chat with the people around you.Written by Morag Paton"

        "body": "With the world population at 7.5 billion people, and those that identify as Christian at 2.4 billion, there is still much to be done. Thankfully, the opportunities to share Jesus are endless! Especially online!The Bible has many references, not only to the need for us to share Jesus, but also that people are ready to receive Jesus.\u00a0[2 Corinthians 6:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+6%3A2&version=NKJV)\u00a0says:\u00a0*Now is the favourable time. Now is the day of salvation,\u00a0*and[Luke 10:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A2&version=NKJV)\u00a0says:\u00a0*The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few.*## Here are 4 practical ways to share Jesus\u00a0online:# 1. Post Intentional QuestionsWhen Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in\u00a0[Matthew 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A15-18&version=NLV)\u00a0with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in\u00a0[Mark 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-18&version=NLT), or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. People love to talk and give their opinion. Get them talking about things that matter.The most effective questions are powerful and thought provoking. They are clear, concise, open-ended and invite discussion. When asking questions, wait for the answer don't provide the answer. God wants to reveal Himself to the world, so ask questions that allow Him to do so.**Here are 6 Questions you could ask online:**- Why do you think bad things happen?- What would it take for you to believe in God?- What has been your experience of prayer?- What are your thoughts on Jesus?- Have you ever wondered what your purpose was?- Do you have questions about God or faith?# 2. Offer\u00a0PrayerPeople are open to spiritual things, we just don't think they are. People are open to conversations about God, they are just waiting for us to start them.Prayer is an awesome way to raise spiritual curiosity in people and a great gateway to spiritual conversations. Every opportunity is an opportunity to offer prayer.# 3. Share your TestimonyWhether you're a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and today is the perfect day to share yours online.Your story matters and your experience matters. They matter because people relate to personal stories and experiences. Share your story & help people understand that Christians are just 'broken people made whole through Jesus.'# 4. Share a\u00a0VideoJesus shared the hope in His heart through stories. He was a master storyteller. In fact, the Bible shows that storytelling was His favorite technique to communicate and reveal truth. Sharing videos is a great way to share the hope in our heart.The message of the Gospel must never change. However, the method/medium by which we spread the Gospel absolutely should. Sharing videos is a great way to share Jesus. Videos help explain what we cannot explain.The\u00a0yesHEis app\u00a0is full of videos worth sharing.# When it comes to sharing Jesus, your greatest ability is your availability.

        "title": "3 Tips to Share Your Faith",
        "body": "Sometimes the thought of sharing your faith with someone can feel daunting and it\u2019s hard to know where to start. You\u2019re not alone! I\u2019ve been sharing my faith with people for years, yet I can still have those moments where I feel like I\u2019ve been given a shot of adrenaline, my heart races and my mind suddenly seems to go blank.There can be this urge to run, change the subject or retreat\u200a\u2014\u200abut if I listen to the still voice of the Holy Spirit inside of me, I do exactly the opposite, I lean in and step out. It\u2019s terrifying at times, but then so exhilarating! As Christians, it is a joy to speak life into the lives of those around us so they too may know the hope of Christ that is within us.Here are 3 promises which have helped me share my faith:01. God is for me (Romans 8:31)02. I have the life of Christ inside me (Galatians 2:20)03. The Holy Spirit will help me (John 14:26\u201327)When talking with friends, sometimes we can be over zealous in enthusiasm to share the truth we know, and our friends can sometimes feel like they are being talked at, rather than talked to, or listened to. Now, I don\u2019t want to curb your enthusiasm, so here are 3 practical tips to help.##1. The goal of sharing your faith is to win people, not argumentsThere\u2019s a fantastic scripture in the Bible, 1 Peter 3:15\u201317\u200a\u2014\u200aBut in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. For it is better, if it is God\u2019s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.It\u2019s important that we spend time in conversation to understand their journey, viewpoints and experiences. Don\u2019t be offended if your friend is really negative about God, offence breeds contention, and that\u2019s the last thing you need. In a situation like this, a good way to respond would be something like; \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that you feel that way, can you explain why?\u201d Try to read between the lines and listen to what is not being said. You will start to notice areas of pain, distrust, anger, sadness etc, keep them in mind as the conversation continues.God\u2019s loving kindness leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4). Ask God to help you be a carrier of that kindness. Kindness isn\u2019t about agreeing, but it\u2019s speaking truth in love. Be careful not to jump to your own conclusions about why your friends are responding in a particular manner, listen to the Holy Spirit and ask questions. Asking questions is a fabulous way to get understanding, and it helps keep the conversation open and friendly.##2. Stay consistent online and offlineDiscipleship and evangelism go hand in hand. Our behaviours and our actions disciple people, the question is what sort of discipleship are we presenting? Take a look at Ephesians 5:15\u201320\u200a\u2014\u200aBe very careful, then, how you live\u200a\u2014\u200anot as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity.Our lives are being watched both offline and online. The online space can be a great place to have conversation, but it\u2019s also a place where people tend to turn into someone or something else! Social media should not be a place to get on your personal \u2018soap box\u2019 and blast opinions at people. It is a place however where a mirage of thoughts, opinions and lives are shared for all to see.If you do happen to get \u2018blasted\u2019 by a friend because of a post you have shared or you feel to \u2018blast\u2019 someone back, \u2018stop\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200atake a breath and a moment to think and pray first.- Is there more to the story you need to ask first- How can I respond in a loving and kind way?\u2013 Give \u201cbite sized\u201d responses that people can digest- Consider, does this conversation need to happen in a private message or offline?##3. Use language which is easily understoodYour friends will understand you better if you use everyday language. Be intentional with your choice of words. Sometimes without thinking we start using words that would only be heard in church or read in the Bible. In conversation, avoid words like; atonement for your sin, blood of the lamb, born again, sanctification, or hedge of protection. The list can go on! I had a funny discussion with some friends the other night about, what does a \u201ctraveling mercy\u201d mean?Whether your conversation is online or offline, always take time to consider how to respond to your friends. Trust that the Holy Spirit will guide you as you speak\u200a\u2014\u200aand of course you\u2019re praying for your friends already right?Being vulnerable as we share our lives with others helps them see we are not some super human, but, just like them, we also struggle. People connect with stories. As much as possible try to share through story telling. Can you relate the situation to a personal experience you\u2019ve had?"

        "body": "Having moved around to new places and cities where I didn\u2019t know anyone, I have learned, through experience, that the best way to make new friends, is to be a friend. Everyone has a few basic social needs, whether they are a socialite or a wall flower, whether they are just out of school or about to retire. When you take an interest in people, you will arouse their interest.People want to be heard, feel needed loved and feel a sense of acceptance and belonging. The difference between an acquaintance and a friend, is how many of these conditions you meet for the other person.The barista at the caf\u00e9 you see every day may feel you need her because she provides a service for you, but unless you listen to her dreams, goals and fears and show understanding and compassion towards her, she will only ever be an acquaintance.It is the same with social media. Have you ever wondered why Facebook affects so many relationships and why people who have never met in person, travel around the world to get married, simply because of an online friendship? It\u2019s because through unguarded and candid communication, people have managed to form solid emotional bonds with another.When we are communicating the love of Jesus to someone online, it is so important to display that love tangibly. We are communicating with lost people and we need to be a genuine friend who listens, loves and accepts.**They aren\u2019t a project; they are a person.**"

        "body": "We all have that one friend that is great at telling stories. Whether it\u2019s a crazy story of adventure or a sad tale of heartache, we enjoy listening to them because they grab our attention and take us on a journey. They don\u2019t just convey information, they capture our imagination. They connect with our emotions and leave us wanting more.Jesus was that guy! He was a master storyteller. Thousands would gather to listen to Him; they hung off his every word. He used stories to share the hope in His heart, to conjure deep thought, to challenge mindsets and to change lives. He spoke like a poet, using parable, overstatement, metaphor, sarcasm and dramatic action. Storytelling was His favourite way to communicate and reveal truth.> However, not only did Jesus tell stories full of meaning and purpose, He lived a life full of meaning and\u00a0purpose.He lived in a way which encouraged people to step up while challenging others to step down. He held himself with dexterity which raised intrigue, whilst also flipping tables which raised eyebrows. He extended grace to the sinner, instilling value, whilst challenging the values of the religious. Without doubt, the influence of His stories and His life has had an unparalleled impact on humanity. Multiplied millions have fashioned their lives and beliefs on His words and His life.As followers of Jesus we are empowered to do the same as Jesus. We are empowered to encourage, raise intrigue, extend grace, instil value and show and tell the goodness and power of God. In the book of Acts, before ascending to Heaven, Jesus releases his followers to be power-filled storytellers. He says:\u201cI promise you this\u200a\u2014\u200athe Holy Spirit will come upon you and you will be filled with power. And you will be my messengers to Jerusalem, throughout Judea, the distant provinces\u200a\u2014\u200aeven to the remotest places on earth!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200a[Acts 1:8 TPT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A8-10&version=TPT)We can feel confident to tell great stories and live great lives because we have been given the Holy Spirit. Jesus didn\u2019t just show us how to live and then leave us on our own; no, He empowered us. The same power that opened the eyes of the blind and raised the dead has been given to us. The same Holy Spirit which inspired the writings of the Bible and revives the repentant heart lives in us. We can live confident to share Jesus knowing we have the Holy Spirit with us.> After being empowered, we are simply asked to be messengers. To show and tell the goodness and power of\u00a0God.We don\u2019t need to be eloquent preachers with a pulpit or a famous evangelist with a big story. We just need to use our everyday moments as our pulpit to share Christ\u2019s big story. The stories we tell about Jesus and the way we live like Jesus can bring freedom, healing, and hope to others.Generally speaking, over the years, we have been better protectors of the Gospel story than purveyors of it. We have gone in to fight for and protect the Gospel rather than show its power and tell its story. While this has been the way, it doesn\u2019t have to be the way.Consider this a call to tell better stories and live better lives. Not because we are better, rather because we know a God who can change people\u2019s lives for the better. Let\u2019s capture imagination and replace the cringe factor with a curiosity factor. Let\u2019s connect with people\u2019s emotions and have them asking questions rather than asking to leave.Let\u2019s raise our own level of living so we can see people raised to life. Let\u2019s keep telling our God stories so that people can encounter God and have a story of their own."

It says in\u00a0[Matthew 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10&version=NIV):\u201c\u2026Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.> \u00a0And as you go, preach, saying, \u2018The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u2019 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons.\u201d (emphasis added)As you go about your day... No big plan is required, nor a massive outreach program to organise. Just you. How good is that! I love it!##### I challenge you today to start a God conversation in whichever line you find yourself waiting\u00a0in!Even if you don\u2019t get to the God part straight away, just practice starting conversations. Grow your social skills and get better at speaking and listening. Show an interest in them. Be kind. Ask questions that make them feel valued. Dig for the need that you can pray for.Just start."

        "body": "Sharing your personal testimony is one of the most natural ways to have a God conversation. It\u2019s also one of the most effective ways because your personal experience is harder to dismiss or refute because it happened to you.Let\u2019s be honest, everyone loves a good story, and there aren\u2019t many better stories than God coming through in a situation. Think back to a time when God answered your prayers or showed you He is real or did something miraculous.It\u2019s useful to have God stories like these on hand, so you can use them in a conversation when the opportunity presents itself. A great purpose for your testimony is to create a desire in the hearts of others to say: \u201cI want that!\u201d> Focus on what God has done and can do, and do your best to avoid Christianese words.Make sure they understand what you are saying and ask what they think about it. Be sensitive to the signals they are sending that indicate their interest. It is vitally important for you to pick up on those signals, so you can follow up with relevant questions and go deeper in conversation.Remember: The story of what God has done in your life is key to others experiencing Him too."

I had a chance to talk to *Ben recently, and I\u2019d like to take you on a journey of how he got connected to Jesus. He wrote:_\u201cHi I\u2019m Ben, I saw this app and something is telling me to install it. For every years of my life passed, I\u2019ve been trying so hard to stop the works of the devil in my life. I really need Jesus to change my story today, so I don\u2019t get fooled by satan anymore.\u201d_This is an open invitation (and believe it or not, these aren\u2019t uncommon). Ben got stopped by an ad to install our\u00a0[app](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/JSHS), not because he was wanting to share his faith, but because he wanted to know Jesus.> Every single day there are hundreds of thousands of people scrolling and looking for something more\u2026So quite simply, if we continue to put out open invitations for people to engage with content about Jesus, sooner or later someone will stop by for a look! Then the rest of the journey is about helping that person connect to Jesus.My response to Ben was; a friendly hello, direction to a video that could explain what following Jesus meant, and an offer to help answer his questions._\u201cYes I\u2019ve got lots of questions about how to be saved. I\u2019m going to call this app a \u2018Rescue Mission Fellowship\u2019 cause I came in to be rescued that\u2019s all\u201d._I personally find videos to be an amazing way of bringing a visual explanation, and it saves me a\u00a0whole\u00a0lot of typing.\u00a0[Falling Plates](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/4x5X)\u00a0(inside our\u00a0[yesHEis\u00a0](https://yhm2h.app.goo.gl/JSHS)app) is a fantastic video that speaks powerfully to many people who watch it._\u201cI\u2019ve been a broken plate\u2026that\u2019s how my past was, which is broken to pieces\u2026\u201d_After a short discussion, I asked if Ben would like to make Jesus boss of his life, to which he answered\u00a0_\u201cI\u2019m ready\u201d_. I then typed out something for him to pray out loud to God, right where he was, then boom\u200a\u2014\u200asalvation!With our help, Ben is now connected to a local church. And honestly, that was probably the hardest part of this story. The reason being that;> People are after relationship, they need connection. Without someone there to help, connection can get\u00a0lost.I\u2019ll expand on that a little more. The church were great; they welcomed him, prayed for him, he even filled in a connection card\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, I noticed he had ended up taking it home\u2026With a few gentle questions, he opened up to say he was struggling to connect and felt nervous. Who wouldn\u2019t?! It\u2019s a tough gig getting along to a church by yourself, meeting a whole lot of new people, and in an environment you\u2019re not familiar with.With a quick call to the church and forwarding through his contact details, that was all sorted. He\u2019s now got a Bible to read, a church to attend, and friends to connect with that know Jesus.And it doesn\u2019t stop there. Ben has now shared his story with a colleague.All that started with an ad on a social feed. What video could you share today for someone to find?_*Name changed_"

Yet, once it has been attained, it seldom solves our deepest needs\u200a\u2014\u200athis is why there are as many love songs as there are heartbreak songs. So what are we missing? Is there something more? What is true love?In\u00a0[John 15:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A13&version=NIV), Jesus gives us a clear and succinct answer:\u00a0_\u201cFor the greatest love of all is a love that sacrifices all. And this great love is demonstrated when a person sacrifices his life for his friends.\u201d_Jesus puts himself on the line as an example and pattern for us to follow. True love is not measured by a feeling that we \u2018get\u2019, rather it is measured by how much of ourselves that we \u2018give\u2019. True love is sacrifice.A mother\u2019s love for her unborn baby, a single Dad working multiple jobs to look after his son, a teenager sacrificing his wage for his sick Mum, or an elderly couple who have weathered the storms of life together. These are all beautiful examples of sacrifice\u200a\u2014\u200aand are mere shadows of the fullness of Jesus\u2019 love for us which was displayed by His sacrificial death on the cross.##### Cross Equals\u00a0LoveThis Easter, as the story of the cross gets thrown front and centre in our culture, let\u2019s take this unique opportunity to share about Jesus and His love for humanity.We\u2019ve tailor-made a video that you can share this Easter to start this conversation with a friend.

While we all consume copious amounts of chocolate, statistics suggest that as the chocolate intake increases, so does the interest in Christianity. So then, how do we make the most of the season? Simple, share your own testimony.> When you share your own testimony, you are in fact sharing the Easter\u00a0story.Let us explain, the Easter story is the narrative of Jesus\u2019 death on the cross and His resurrection\u200a\u2014\u200ait is the moment in which death was conquered and we were set free from sin. When we share how Jesus has changed our lives, we are revealing the transformational power of Jesus\u2019s death and resurrection.There is a great example of this in the book of\u00a0[Corinthians](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A1-11&version=NIV)\u00a0in the New Testament. Paul (a man who used to persecute Christians) writes that it is only\u00a0because of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection that he has been saved. He shares that it is because of Jesus\u2019 death, he has died to his old ways and like Jesus\u2019 resurrection, he has been birthed into this new life. He shares his own story in the context of the Easter story.Maybe our story isn\u2019t as dramatic as Paul\u2019s but just like Paul and millions of other Christians, our own stories are a result of the Easter story.We too can share the power of the Easter story by sharing our own story\u200a\u2014\u200ahere is a simple structure that might help:1. Your life before Jesus2. How you met Jesus3. Your life with JesusGo for it and try and use these three simple points to frame how you share your testimony.Remember, when sharing your testimony, we are ultimately directing people to Jesus. Pray beforehand and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you as you share."

        "body": "No one likes awkward conversations. Especially on a plane. Planes have a special way of defining what kind of person you are. I\u2019m cheap, so I usually catch early-morning flights. On early flights, people are usually happy to stay under the radar, read a book, quietly sip a coffee while staring out the window, or just solidly gaze into the back of their eyelids with their mouth open while heavy breathing.Recently I took an early flight with my mate Dan. He quickly locked into the last option. I\u2019d just downloaded Bob Goff\u2019s latest book \u2018[Everybody Always](https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Always-Becoming-Setbacks-Difficult/dp/0718078136)\u2019 to my\u00a0_Kindle,_\u00a0so I opened that and nestled in for a quiet \u2018Option 2\u2019.Bob\u2019s book is all about loving everybody, always\u200a\u2014\u200aand this particular chapter was talking about loving our neighbours and encouraging them on the journey of faith. Not just our literal next-door neighbours, but that we actually find neighbours everywhere. In our workplace, our cafes, yoga-classes and, you guessed it, next to us on planes.I quickly glanced at the guy next to me; my current\u00a0_neighbour_. He was probably pushing 60, looked like he\u2019d seen the sun most days of his life and was reading some fiction book about CIA spy missions. Now I\u2019ve got a pretty high threshold for social awkwardness. I don\u2019t usually mind putting myself out there. But, I questioned,\u00a0_\u201cwas I really meant to interrupt this guy? How was I meant to do that? And what if he really was ex-CIA? I wasn\u2019t ready for a painful death.\u201d_> I thought to myself\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cWell, if God\u2019s plan is to use me, then I\u2019m going to put it back on Him to get me in/out of this scenario.\u201d So, that\u2019s what I\u00a0did.I just honestly said_\u00a0\u201cLook Jesus, I don\u2019t really care if I talk to this guy or not, but if you want me to, can you get him to put down his CIA spy manual and talk to me? And also, can he please not kill me in a painful way? k.thanks.bye.\u201d_Then I put my book away and just sat there waiting. 5 mins later he gets a coffee, puts his book down and says, \u201c_So, what do you do for a biscuit?_\u201d\u00a0\u2026Ha!It turned out he wasn\u2019t ex-CIA, he was an awesome guy; a retired teacher. He was visiting his son (who was moving to my city\u2014 another potential neighbour!) and he was super happy and open to chat. As we talked I couldn\u2019t quite see how I was going to steer the conversation \u201cspiritually,\u201d so I just decided to enjoy the conversation and look for an opportunity.The plane was coming down to land, and that opportunity hadn\u2019t come yet. I didn\u2019t want to awkwardly bring \u2018it\u2019 up out of nowhere so, instead I casually pointed out that it was raining outside.My neighbour, let\u2019s call him \u2018old mate\u2019, replied with this\u200a\u2014\u200a_\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny, you can water your garden with the hose as much as you like, but if the same amount of rain falls on it, it just seems to flourish.\u201d_\u00a0There it was! My opportunity! So, I took it!> I simply opened my mouth and shared what I thought about rain from a spiritual perspective._\u201cWell, from my perspective, that\u2019s God. If God created the world, why wouldn\u2019t the rain that he created be the thing that makes it flourish in the best way.\u201d\u00a0_I said.He replied,\u00a0_\u201cYeah I guess. I\u2019m not that religious though. I went to a catholic church when I grew up but haven\u2019t gone back for years.\u201d_I smiled on the inside as I knew I had turned a conversation to God and said:\u00a0_\u201cYeah I grew up in a religious church too. It wasn\u2019t until I started reading the Bible and thinking \u2018If Jesus really existed, if this is really true, this could actually change my life.\u201d_> The conversation went on. It wasn\u2019t awkward. I didn\u2019t Bible bash him. I didn\u2019t lead him in the \u2018sinners prayer\u2019. I simply opened my mouth and shared my thoughts and asked what his\u00a0were.I am a fairly normal guy. I don\u2019t consider myself an evangelist and turning conversations towards God isn\u2019t something I do every day (yet). But, it definitely was exciting to see God throw me an opportunity and it was fun to step up and take it.I took up Jesus\u2019 invitation to join Him in the great co-mission, of restoring humanity to Him. I invited the Holy Spirit to guide me and then obeyed His promptings.I have no idea what \u2018old mate\u2019 is thinking now about our conversation. I\u2019m just praying that the conversation we had was a seed that would grow in some way."

        "body": "Have you ever binge-watched a TV series so much that by the end you have an emotional connection with all of the characters?\u2026 eh, yeah who hasn\u2019t! And then there is that moment when you are out at a party and somebody else hasn\u2019t watched that TV show, so you feel it is your right to spend the next 3 hours preaching to them the whole narrative and that they HAVE TO WATCH IT!! (You know you have!)Well, funnily enough, reading the Bible effects us in a similar way. It connects us with Jesus and mobilises us to share His great narrative. In fact, reading the Bible doesn\u2019t give us some sort of empathetic view of Jesus\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a spiritual exercise that connects us with Jesus himself. This is true for all of scripture, both the Old and New Testament.There is a brilliant moment in the book of\u00a0[_John_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A36-40&version=NIV)\u00a0when Jesus is speaking to all sorts of religious and influential figures and has a mic drop moment by stating that He Himself is the fulfilment of scripture! Whilst they have all been looking for eternal life in the pages of scripture, the pages of scripture have been pointing to Jesus the whole time. There is a classic lesson taught in most kids churches and Bible schools, that when we read history\u200a\u2014\u200awe are in fact reading HISstory\u2026(Jesus\u2019 story).##### What does this tell\u00a0us?As we read the great narrative of the Bible\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the story of creation in Genesis right through to the prophetic book of Revelation (even those difficult bits)\u200a\u2014\u200aour relationship with Jesus gets stronger and stronger. To illustrate, reading theBible is like focusing a camera lens, the more we engage with the texts, the more we focus the lens, the more we see and connect with Jesus.##### How do we\u00a0respond?We read and tell. Be encouraged, you do not need a university degree to read the Bible, you do not need to be an expert or certain age to understand what it says. You just need to pick it up (or open the app) and start reading. Set yourself a challenge, try and read the Bible for 5 minutes a day and as the pieces start to come together\u200a\u2014\u200ashare it, use the great narrative of scripture to point people to Jesus."

But also amazing.> Here\u2019s the lesson: The thing that I think will cost me most is actually the most constructive thing for\u00a0me.It\u2019s like that with relationships too. Often life gets in the way of people and I just feel like finding a cave somewhere and sitting by myself in the dark.

What better way to be introduced to Jesus than through a\u00a0miracle!Check out some highlights of the Empowered Conference."

        "title": "6 Ways to Arouse Curiosity When Sharing Jesus",
        "body": "I vividly remember the first time I saw someone \u2018evangelising\u2019 on a street corner. I was 10 years old waiting at an intersection with my parents, when an older gentleman stood on a milk crate and began to speak at us about sin.I specifically remember thinking \u201cOh, that is weird, please stop.\u201d Those around waiting with us, didn\u2019t really pay any attention to him at all. I saw a young couple nudge each other, point and giggle but for the majority of the people within ears reach, he did not arouse an ounce of curiosity with his words.Evangelism by definition is the announcement, proclamation and/or preaching the gospel. It is a work of communication in which Christians make themselves a mouthpiece for God\u2019s message of grace and mercy to sinners. So, technically I guess it could be said that the older gentleman was evangelising, although I am unsure if it was a message of grace and mercy.Evangelism is a scary word. As a concept and a commission, evangelism is great. However, as an action, the outworking of it over the years has sadly left a bitter taste in the mouths of many.For us, evangelism is sharing Jesus; and sharing Jesus is just as much about what we do as it is about what we say, and even more so about how we say it.If you were to ask a non Christian, what they thought when they heard the term evangelical? They would probably reply something like: \u201cOh, those are the Christians that bait and switch. They\u2019re nice to your face, but they really just want to convert you.\u201d Sadly, there are many people who have been burnt by deceptive evangelism which didn\u2019t care for them as a person as much as it cared for their conversion. Taking interest in the lives and views of others, rather than just trying to \u2018push a message\u2019 always has greater return.Here are 6 ways to arouse curiosity in when sharing Jesus:####1. Reclaim the Definition of ChristianTo arouse curiosity and engage culture we need to reclaim the definition of \u2018Christian\u2019. We must help people understand that Christians are just \u2018broken people made whole through Jesus\u2019 (Romans 3:23, 2 Corinthians 5:17). We are not an exclusive club of do-gooders or a special interest group. Rather, we are every day people who have come to terms with our brokenness and accepted the grace and mercy of God.####2. Model JesusThe greatest model of faith sharing is the model which Jesus exampled to us. When you read the bible, Jesus and other biblical figures used the power of curiosity. When expected to judge, Jesus wouldn\u2019t. (Check the story of the women caught in adultery in John 8:1\u201311) He would shock people by being in the unlikeliest of places; when others thought He should be attending to religious matters, He was having dinner with prostitute and thieves (Matthew 9:9\u201312). Rather than being on the fringe of community, Jesus was always at the heart of it. There is much to learn from that.>_Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more easily._####3. Ask QuestionsWhen Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in Matthew 22:15\u201318 with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in Mark 10:17\u201318, or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. It is easy to be an armchair expert and make general statements when it comes to our faith, but too often general statements don\u2019t allow grace for a person\u2019s situation, nor do they create an environment conducive to conversation. Jesus was interested in relationship, so He would ask questions which spoke to a person\u2019s heart. Sometimes, it is a question that gets the wheels turning in a person\u2019s head regarding what they believe to be true.####4. Lay the GroundworkWhen it comes to sharing your faith, rather than rushing to get a result (decision/conversion), it\u2019s good to lay the groundwork for people to experience discovery, joy and delight in Christ. Create an environment which arouses a curiosity towards your faith rather than an environment which possibly pushes people away from faith (like the man on the milk crate).Psychologists will explain how curiosity is powerful, while marketing departments will prove its power through our happiness to purchase goods. Curiosity is the innovation driving and emotion calming skill that comes naturally to us as kids. It creates an openness to unfamiliar experiences, laying the groundwork for greater opportunities to experience discovery, joy and delight. Curious people are inclined to act in ways that allow relationships to develop more easily.####5. Arouse Spiritual CuriosityPeople are more spiritual than we give them credit for, so naturally they begin to become ripe with intrigue when we live out our faith in a way that isn\u2019t condemning. Surprisingly, there are stories of people coming to Christ through a message they heard from a man on a milk crate, yet there are many more stories of people coming to faith because they watched a friend or work mate live out their faith.>_Our aim isn\u2019t to become experts in arousing curiosity, our aim is to become more like Christ._Culture tells us \u2018we are all on a spiritual journey and that all journeys are equally valid.\u2019 While this is partly true (all are on a spiritual journey) as Christians we ought be able to show the distinctiveness of Jesus and His incredible saving grace through the way we live. Living in a way that arouses curiosity in others does not ignore the fact that people are dead in sin, it just gives us credibility when it comes to the moment of helping people realise that.####6. ApologiseIt is amazing how far an apology can take you. There have been many unusual things said and done in the name of evangelism and often non Christians can find those a hurdle to accepting Christ. When arousing curiosity, be apologetic for the evangelistic faux pas which have given Jesus a bad name, while also being unapologetic about the truth of the gospel to transform any life and any culture.I am sure there are many other ways to arouse curiosity, but why not start with these. The aim isn\u2019t to become an expert in arousing curiosity, the aim is to become more like Christ.If becoming like Christ is our \u2018what\u2019, then there is great importance to \u2018how\u2019 we share our faith.Remember the words of Jesus in Matthew 10:16 when He said: \u201cStay alert. This is hazardous work I\u2019m assigning you. You\u2019re going to be like sheep running through a wolf pack, so don\u2019t call attention to yourselves. Be as cunning as a snake, inoffensive as a dove.\u201d"

        "body": "Stuck at the Block Buster line waiting for the next UV? Are you about to explode with impatience as you wait your turn in the bank? Or have you resigned to the fact that\u00a0_\u2018forever\u2019_\u00a0exists in our country, the home of waiting in long lines, the Philippines?Lines are just one of those things which you have no control over how fast they move. Lines force you to stop. And while waiting can be frustrating, these are actually great places to chat with strangers, as they are as stuck as you are.We just have to see these long pauses as opportunities to connect with someone and share Jesus with them.I am often inspired by a little part of the first ever Mission\u2019s trip that Jesus sent his disciples on. It says in\u00a0[Matthew 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10&version=NIV):\u201c\u2026Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.> \u00a0And as you go, preach, saying, \u2018The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u2019 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons.\u201d (emphasis added)You don\u2019t need a grand plan as you go about your day. You\u2019re not even required to organize a massive outreach program. You just need you to see those seemingly daily nuances as God opening the window so you can share Him!Don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t get to the God part straight away, you can practice starting conversations. Grow your social skills and get better at speaking and listening. Show an interest in the people you speak with. Be kind. Ask questions that make them feel valued. Dig for the need that you can pray for.Just start."

Thousands would gather to listen to Him; they hung off his every word. He used stories to share the hope in His heart, to conjure deep thought, to challenge mindsets and to change lives. He spoke like a poet, using parable, overstatement, metaphor, sarcasm and dramatic action. Storytelling was His favourite way to communicate and reveal truth.> However, not only did Jesus tell stories full of meaning and purpose, He lived a life full of meaning and\u00a0purpose.He lived in a way which encouraged people to step up while challenging others to step down. He held himself with dexterity which raised intrigue, whilst also flipping tables which raised eyebrows. He extended grace to the sinner, instilling value, whilst challenging the values of the religious. Without doubt, the influence of His stories and His life has had an unparalleled impact on humanity.

We are empowered to encourage, raise intrigue, extend grace, instil value and show and tell the goodness and power of God.

        "body": "With the world population at 7.5 billion people, and those that identify as Christian at 2.4 billion, there is still much to be done. Thankfully, the opportunities to share Jesus are endless!The Bible has many references, not only to the need for us to share Jesus, but also that people are ready to receive Jesus. 2 Corinthians 6:2 says: Now is the favourable time. Now is the day of salvation, and Luke 10:2 says: The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few.*God is already at work on the earth.*The Church in China is under persecution, yet continues to see thousands receive Jesus, with a predicted 250 million Christians by 2030. More Iranians have become Christians in the last 20 years than in the previous 13 centuries put together. In Australia and New Zealand, churches are consistently seeing hundreds receive Jesus at regular weekend services. This is not unusual in other countries either.>_We repeat, the opportunities to share Jesus are endless!_There are many ways to share Jesus; from organised to organic and even outrageous. From speaking on the streets, to mission trips, or inviting people to weekend church services. Each of these are effective, however the challenge for each of us is to share Jesus in a way that we find natural, and effective.*Living on mission.*At yesHEis, sharing Jesus is part of living on mission. It goes further than random acts of kindness and one off invitations to church (though these are still great). It is about being led by the Holy Spirit daily, acting on His promptings and learning to weave the story of Jesus into people\u2019s lives.>_When it comes to sharing Jesus, your greatest ability is your availability. Who are you making yourself available for today?_You don\u2019t need to be an eloquent preacher with a pulpit or a famous evangelist with a big story. You just need to use your everyday moments as your pulpit to share Christ\u2019s big story. There are opportunities with your next door neighbours, at university or online when you are chatting with friends.*Talking about online opportunities, think about this\u2026*If Facebook and Instagram were countries, their combined population would be 2.4 billion. That\u2019s larger than China and the USA combined! So if we continue to imagine Facebook and Instagram as countries, perhaps we should be sending missionaries, right?On top of that, studies show that children now spend more time online than watching TV, and adults spend over 10 hours a day connected online. Regardless of whether these stats have a positive or negative impact on society, they certainly show there are more opportunities now than ever before to engage online with the message of Jesus.*Hope, love and life.*So, in the face of opportunity, each of us are left with 2 options; to seize it, or to let it go. We invite you to seize the opportunity with us and help bring hope, love and life."

        "body": "I hate exercise. But I love it. Every Tuesday afternoon I have the \u201copportunity\u201d to do a HIIT class. \u2018HIIT\u2019 stands for High-Intensity Interval Training. Let\u2019s be honest, it should be spelt P.A.I.N. It\u2019s aptly named because it actually does feel like a punch in the face.Every week I get onto the same emotional rollercoaster. Leading up to HIIT class I\u2019m dreading it. Asking myself questions like \u201cWhy do I hate myself\u201d, \u201cWhy am I putting myself through this again?\u201d But then, every week after it is all over and I haven\u2019t vomited, I feel amazing! My body is fully alive; exhausted and numb, yes. But also amazing.Here\u2019s the lesson: The thing that I think will cost me most is actually the most constructive thing for me.It\u2019s like that with relationships too. Often life gets in the way of people and I just feel like finding a cave somewhere and sitting by myself in the dark. Yet, whenever I just suck it up and open up\u200a\u2014\u200atext or call a friend, talk to my wife, play with my son\u200a\u2014\u200ait always fills me up. The same applies to my relationship with Jesus.Recently I have felt challenged to go deeper with Jesus. So in a moment of righteous motivation, I decided to set my alarm for 5am every morning to give myself a good amount of time to hang out with Him. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but to be honest, the first time that alarm went off, I was kicking myself. What was I thinking??? I have a 3yr old and a full time job\u200a\u2014\u200aI am going to be SO tired at the end of the day!Do you know what? I am now a few months into my new routine, and I\u2019m still alive! I haven\u2019t been tired at any debilitating level and I actually feel energised and super enthusiastic about living life with Jesus.The thing I thought would cost me, actually turned out to to build me up.I want to encourage you. A vibrant relationship with Jesus is something that we all need. Especially if we\u2019re not meant to keep it to ourselves.There\u2019s no point sharing about how awesome life with Jesus is, if we\u2019re not actually living an awesome life with Jesus.If you want to be living an awesome life with Jesus, if you want to get to know Him better. Here\u2019s my tip\u200a\u2014\u200ahang out! Be intentional. It won\u2019t just happen on it\u2019s own. If it\u2019s important to you, then prioritise it. Carve out some time and write off the cost.Here are some challenging questions to ask yourself\u2026Does your relationship with Jesus energise your life?What could you change to take it to the next level?What would that cost you?And my encouragement is this\u2026 the thing you think will cost you, will end up constructing you."

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Write My Testimony? ",
        "body": "Whether you\u2019re a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and we are here to help you write yours!Let\u2019s get to it!##### What is a Testimony?In a Court of law, a testimony is a formal written or spoken statement which gives evidence or proof of an experience. As a Christian, your testimony is similar, however not formal. Your testimony is an account of what God has done in your life and how you came to know and follow Him through those experiences. Your testimony is your God story.In\u00a0[Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A8&version=NIV)\u00a0in the Bible, Jesus tells us \u201cY_ou will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses._\u201d Sharing your testimony is the perfect way to be a witness.> Sharing personal experiences of how Jesus transformed your life will always have greater impact than an impersonal blanket statement of\u00a0faith.A good testimony should explain:- WHAT your life was like BEFORE you decided to follow Jesus.- WHY you decided to follow Jesus.- HOW your life has changed AFTER following Jesus.#### 8 Essential Steps to Writing Your Testimony##### Step 01\u200a\u2014\u200aPause And Ask God To Help\u00a0YouIt may seem obvious but the truth is, we often forget to pray. So, take a moment to pause and ask the Holy Spirit \u201c_What aspect of my life do you want me to share?_\u201d Chances are, you may already have an idea about what you want to write, but take the time to ask Him first. He may have something specific.##### Step 02\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life Before Following JesusDescribe what your life was like before you decided to follow Jesus. This sets up your story. Write a paragraph or two. No need to go any longer than 300 words. Confidently detail your thoughts and emotions at the time.Answer questions like:- What was my life truly like? (Lonely, Empty, Shallow, etc)- What did my life revolve around the most?(Work, A partner, Alcohol, etc)- What did I get my security or happiness from? (Success, Possessions, etc)- How did those areas begin to let me down?##### Step 03\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe When And Why You Chose To Follow\u00a0JesusSimply write a paragraph or two (300 words) explaining why you chose to explore life with Jesus.Answer questions like:- When was the first time I heard the Gospel or about Jesus?- What were my initial reactions?- When did my attitude begin to change? Why?- What were the final struggles that went through my mind before I accepted Jesus?- Why did I go ahead and accept Jesus?##### Step 04\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life After Following JesusThis is where you can begin to join the dots and bring closure to your testimony. Talk about how this experience has shaped or changed you.Write a sentence or two on each of these points:- How has this experience changed your perspective of God and life?- Describe how this has impacted the way you live, feel and think.- How has this story changed the way you relate to and understand God?- This is the most impacting part, because now you\u2019re presenting a view of God based on things that really happened to you.##### Step 05\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your Language\u00a0SimpleIt is best to avoid using \u201cChristian\u201d language that people unfamiliar with Christianity wouldn\u2019t understand. Use normal every-day language.\u201cChristians routinely use words like sin, salvation, fellowship, sanctification, and the Gospel without realising these phrases can leave their friends confused or even repelled.\u201d> \u200a\u2014\u200aLuke CawleyIf you find yourself using words like this, try and replace them with commonly used phrases. Rather than using a phrase like \u2018my sins are washed by the blood\u2019, try say something like \u2018Jesus has forgiven the things I did wrong, and has given me a fresh start\u2019. It\u2019s not to say the first isn\u2019t true, but people are simply not familiar with that language.##### Step 06\u200a\u2014\u200aGet\u00a0FeedbackGive a copy to a Christian friend, and get their feedback. Ask them if they think there is anything you could add or change to make your testimony stronger. Better yet, read it out loud to them.

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Write My Testimony?",
        "body": "Whether you\u2019re a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and we are here to help you write yours!Let\u2019s get to it!##### What is a Testimony?In a Court of law, a testimony is a formal written or spoken statement which gives evidence or proof of an experience. As a Christian, your testimony is similar, however not formal. Your testimony is an account of what God has done in your life and how you came to know and follow Him through those experiences. Your testimony is your God story.In\u00a0[Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A8&version=NIV)\u00a0in the Bible, Jesus tells us \u201cY_ou will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses._\u201d Sharing your testimony is the perfect way to be a witness.> Sharing personal experiences of how Jesus transformed your life will always have greater impact than an impersonal blanket statement of\u00a0faith.A good testimony should explain:- WHAT your life was like BEFORE you decided to follow Jesus.- WHY you decided to follow Jesus.- HOW your life has changed AFTER following Jesus.#### 8 Essential Steps to Writing Your Testimony##### Step 01\u200a\u2014\u200aPause And Ask God To Help\u00a0YouIt may seem obvious but the truth is, we often forget to pray. So, take a moment to pause and ask the Holy Spirit \u201c_What aspect of my life do you want me to share?_\u201d Chances are, you may already have an idea about what you want to write, but take the time to ask Him first. He may have something specific.##### Step 02\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life Before Following JesusDescribe what your life was like before you decided to follow Jesus. This sets up your story. Write a paragraph or two. No need to go any longer than 300 words. Confidently detail your thoughts and emotions at the time.Answer questions like:- What was my life truly like? (Lonely, Empty, Shallow, etc)- What did my life revolve around the most?(Work, A partner, Alcohol, etc)- What did I get my security or happiness from? (Success, Possessions, etc)- How did those areas begin to let me down?##### Step 03\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe When And Why You Chose To Follow\u00a0JesusSimply write a paragraph or two (300 words) explaining why you chose to explore life with Jesus.Answer questions like:- When was the first time I heard the Gospel or about Jesus?- What were my initial reactions?- When did my attitude begin to change? Why?- What were the final struggles that went through my mind before I accepted Jesus?- Why did I go ahead and accept Jesus?##### Step 04\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life After Following JesusThis is where you can begin to join the dots and bring closure to your testimony. Talk about how this experience has shaped or changed you.Write a sentence or two on each of these points:- How has this experience changed your perspective of God and life?- Describe how this has impacted the way you live, feel and think.- How has this story changed the way you relate to and understand God?- This is the most impacting part, because now you\u2019re presenting a view of God based on things that really happened to you.##### Step 05\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your Language\u00a0SimpleIt is best to avoid using \u201cChristian\u201d language that people unfamiliar with Christianity wouldn\u2019t understand. Use normal every-day language.\u201cChristians routinely use words like sin, salvation, fellowship, sanctification, and the Gospel without realising these phrases can leave their friends confused or even repelled.\u201d> \u200a\u2014\u200aLuke CawleyIf you find yourself using words like this, try and replace them with commonly used phrases. Rather than using a phrase like \u2018my sins are washed by the blood\u2019, try say something like \u2018Jesus has forgiven the things I did wrong, and has given me a fresh start\u2019. It\u2019s not to say the first isn\u2019t true, but people are simply not familiar with that language.##### Step 06\u200a\u2014\u200aGet\u00a0FeedbackGive a copy to a Christian friend, and get their feedback. Ask them if they think there is anything you could add or change to make your testimony stronger. Better yet, read it out loud to them. Often things written down sound different when they are spoken out.##### Step 07\u200a\u2014\u200aMemorise The Key\u00a0PointsYou want to be able to tell your story without reading it. It is your story, so it should be easy to do. Write down the key aspects of your story (including events, thoughts, feelings) in sequential order, and list them in bullet points. These will be easier to memorise and enable you to tell your testimony more naturally.##### Step 08\u200a\u2014\u200aShare Your TestimonyNow you have your finished writing your testimony, it\u2019s time to share it with someone.

He wrote:\u201cHi I\u2019m Yash, I saw this app and something is telling me to install it. For every years of my life passed, I\u2019ve been trying so hard to stop the works of the devil in my life. I really need Jesus to change my story today, so I don\u2019t get fooled by satan anymore.\u201dThis is an open invitation (and believe it or not, these aren\u2019t uncommon). Yash got stopped by an ad to install our app, not because he was wanting to share his faith, but because he wanted to know Jesus.Every single day there are hundreds of thousands of people scrolling and looking for something more\u2026So quite simply, if we continue to put out open invitations for people to engage with content about Jesus, sooner or later someone will stop by for a look! Then the rest of the journey is about helping that person connect to Jesus.My response to Yash was; a friendly hello, direction to a video that could explain what following Jesus meant, and an offer to help answer his questions.\u201cYes I\u2019ve got lots of questions about how to be saved. I\u2019m going to call this app a \u2018Rescue Mission Fellowship\u2019 cause I came in to be rescued that\u2019s all\u201d.I personally find videos to be an amazing way of bringing a visual explanation, and it saves me a whole lot of typing.

I then typed out something for him to pray out loud to God, right where he was, then boom\u200a\u2014\u200asalvation!With our help, Yash is now connected to a local church. And honestly, that was probably the hardest part of this story. The reason being that;People are after relationship, they need connection. Without someone there to help, connection can get lost.I\u2019ll expand on that a little more. The church were great; they welcomed him, prayed for him, he even filled in a connection card\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever, I noticed he had ended up taking it home\u2026With a few gentle questions, he opened up to say he was struggling to connect and felt nervous. Who wouldn\u2019t?! It\u2019s a tough gig getting along to a church by yourself, meeting a whole lot of new people, and in an environment you\u2019re not familiar with.With a quick call to the church and forwarding through his contact details, that was all sorted. He\u2019s now got a Bible to read, a church to attend, and friends to connect with that know Jesus.And it doesn\u2019t stop there.

Your goal wouldn\u2019t be to make them runners, you\u2019d just be talking about your life. So why not treat your faith in the same way? Do you go to church? Read your Bible? Pray? Talk about it!Let your friends hear what you believe without any ulterior motives, just as part of who you are."

        "body": "We love hearing stories of how yesHEis has helped people share Jesus, or helped people find Jesus. Recently we received a great story from Bastien our Community Manager in France and thought it was worth sharing\u2026.Enzo* lives in Paris, France and was raised by parents who had different religions. They both taught Enzo that there is only one true God. Enzo knew this was true but was also confused given his parents\u2019 religious differences. As such, Enzo thought he\u2019d mix the two together and get the best of both worlds.He grew more and more curious and searched for online content about God, eventually stumbling upon a yesHEis YouTube ad which lead him to download the yesHEis app. After watching a few videos, Enzo found out that he could ask questions in the app as well. So he started asking questions.This was in September 2017.Our team rigorously responded to every question for months. The conversations eventually continued from the app to text messages. However, eventually, Enzo stopped messaging.We heard nothing for months, until July 2018.Suddenly, we received a text from Enzo. He had reached out to thank the yesHEis team for the support with his journey in finding out more about the Christian faith. He gave the news that he had accepted Christ as his Lord and Saviour and couldn\u2019t be happier!Please thank God for Enzo and his journey and pray for more and more people to grow curious for Christ.What an encouraging story!A great reminder to keep praying for and reaching out to those who may seem cold toward faith, and a great reminder that some people take time to process faith."

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Simply Explain The Gospel?",
        "body": "\u2018The Gospel\u2019 is a phrase thrown around often in Christian circles. To explain the Gospel, it is important to understand what it is. Let\u2019s unpack it quickly\u2026The word \u2018Gospel\u2019 literally means \u2018Good News\u2019 and it is mentioned 90+ times in the Bible. Broadly speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the whole of scripture; the mega narrative of God\u2019s plan to restore humanity to himself.Specifically speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the good news about Jesus. The story of\u00a0_who\u00a0_He is and\u00a0_what\u00a0_He\u00a0did.##### Let\u2019s break it down so you know how to explain it in 3 simple\u00a0steps\u2026#### 1. God\u2019s\u00a0DesignGod created the world. We can see beauty, purpose and evidence of design all around us. It is impossible to ignore. Just look the intricate design of plants, the way the moon influences the tide, or the ever changing colours in a sunset. The Bible tells us that God originally designed a world that worked perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200awhere everything and everyone fit together in harmony. God created us for a purpose. He created us to know Him and to enjoy Him; to live and bring glory and honour to Him._Read:__\u00a0_[_Genesis 1:31_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A31&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Psalm 19:1_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+19%3A1&version=NIV)_\u00a0&\u00a0_[Ephesians 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10)#### 2. Our Brokenness (Sin)If we look around at society, it is easy to see that humanity is not bringing glory to God. Rather there is a brokenness in the world. We see it in the evil of terrorism, we see it in war, violence, abuse, deceit and betrayal. In ignorance to God, we could search high and low for the reason of the brokenness, but the truth is, beneath it all, the problem is spiritual. Really, we are the problem. We have not lived for God, we have not followed His rules, rather we have made our own. We have not valued a relationship with Him. The Bible calls this sin. Sin is running from God, trying to do life our own way. Sin is taking the title of God and putting it upon ourselves. It is because of sin that we as humanity have become hostile, not only towards God, but towards others. The Bible says the consequence of sin is death._Read:__\u00a0_[_Romans 1:25_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A25&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Romans 3:23_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Romans 6:23_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=NIV)_\u00a0&\u00a0_[_Proverbs 14:12_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+14%3A12&version=NIV)#### 3. The Solution\u00a0(Jesus)Brokenness leads to a place of realising a need for help; a remedy, some Good News. God, because of His mercy and great love for us, did not leave us in our brokenness. He sent His Son, Jesus as a solution to our sin problem. Jesus, came to us, lived a perfect sin-free life (exampling life by God\u2019s design) and willingly chose to die in our place to pay the penalty for our sin. He then defeated death and rose to life. He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Simply hearing this good news is not enough, we must act on it and admit to our sinful brokenness, ask God for forgiveness and stop trusting in ourselves. This is when we can begin to understand God\u2019s original design for our lives and the lives of others._Read:\u00a0_[_John 3:16_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Colossians 2:14_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A14&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Mark 1:15_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1%3A15&version=NKJV)_\u00a0&\u00a0_[_Ephesians 2:8\u20139_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8%E2%80%939&version=NKJV)There you go! A simple (but not too simple that you have to re-explain it) version of the Gospel. Remembering the 3 stages and the key parts of each stage will help you feel confident to share the Gospel at any moment.Why not try explaining the Gospel today?"

She has led many people in the decision to make Jesus their boss, and has prompted many others to take time to explore God more for themselves.I asked Tish to write down a few thoughts from her experiences. You might be surprised to hear what she shares.I\u2019ll let her tell the story\u2026_When I first started chatting to people online I found it really confronting because I got to see the words I was choosing to use. I was shocked at how harsh I was, and at times, I was down right weird! I would read back over the conversation and realise how much of what I was saying was actually distracting the person. To make things worse I noticed that I wasn\u2019t being a good listener\u200a\u2014\u200apeople were opening up and sharing their experiences but instead of acknowledging them, I bull-dozed along with a goal in mind._> I think somewhere in my head I thought if I just got them to say a salvation prayer I had done my\u00a0job._This kind of mentality is dangerous and ineffective. It skips past the part where God is wanting to form a personal relationship with the person. I needed to keep it simple\u200a\u2014\u200amy job was to introduce people to Jesus. After a while, I found I had improved, and talking with people online wasn\u2019t such a hard thing. It got me thinking about the way I spoke though; was I any different when chatting to people face-to-face?__I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve figured out the answer to that question yet, I think it\u2019s a work in progress. I know our words don\u2019t have to be fancy and sound spiritual to make an impact. I know people need to know they can be themselves in front of God and just be real with Him._> I\u2019ve learnt to listen more and I have become less \u2018preachy\u2019 and more relational. People aren\u2019t searching for religion, they are searching for relationship.Whether you are interacting with someone online or face to face; when we are genuine and honest, simple and not fancy, quick to listen and slow to get to the end, we can make a real difference in peoples lives.Why not try out your skills and strike up a conversation with someone online? See how you go with keeping things simple. Allow yourself to read over what you shared and see if God is revealing anything to you about how you chat with the people around you."

        "body": "With the world population at 7.5 billion people, and those that identify as Christian at 2.4 billion, there is still much to be done. Thankfully, the opportunities to share Jesus are endless! Especially online!The Bible has many references, not only to the need for us to share Jesus, but also that people are ready to receive Jesus.\u00a0[2 Corinthians 6:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+6%3A2&version=NKJV)\u00a0says:\u00a0_Now is the favourable time. Now is the day of salvation,\u00a0_and_\u00a0_[Luke 10:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A2&version=NKJV)\u00a0says:\u00a0_The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few._#### Here are 4 practical ways to share Jesus\u00a0online:##### 1. Post Intentional QuestionsWhen Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in\u00a0[Matthew 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A15-18&version=NLV)\u00a0with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in\u00a0[Mark 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-18&version=NLT), or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. People love to talk and give their opinion. Get them talking about things that matter.The most effective questions are powerful and thought provoking. They are clear, concise, open-ended and invite discussion. When asking questions, wait for the answer don\u2019t provide the answer. God wants to reveal Himself to the world, so ask questions that allow Him to do so.Here are 6 Questions you could ask online:- Why do you think bad things happen?- What would it take for you to believe in God?- What has been your experience of prayer?- What are your thoughts on Jesus?- Have you ever wondered what your purpose was?- Do you have questions about God or faith?##### 2. Offer\u00a0PrayerPeople are open to spiritual things, we just don\u2019t think they are. People are open to conversations about God, they are just waiting for us to start them.Prayer is an awesome way to raise spiritual curiosity in people and a great gateway to spiritual conversations. Every opportunity is an opportunity to offer prayer.##### 3. Share your TestimonyWhether you\u2019re a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and today is the perfect day to share yours online.Your story matters and your experience matters. They matter because people relate to personal stories and experiences. Share your story & help people understand that Christians are just \u2018broken people made whole through Jesus.\u2019##### 4. Share a\u00a0VideoJesus shared the hope in His heart through stories. He was a master storyteller. In fact, the Bible shows that storytelling was His favorite technique to communicate and reveal truth. Sharing videos is a great way to share the hope in our heart.The message of the Gospel must never change. However, the method/medium by which we spread the Gospel absolutely should. Sharing videos is a great way to share Jesus. Videos help explain what we cannot explain.The\u00a0[yesHEis app]\u00a0is full of videos worth sharing.When it comes to sharing Jesus, your greatest ability is your availability.

        "body": "No one likes awkward conversations. Especially on a plane. Planes have a special way of defining what kind of person you are. I\u2019m cheap, so I usually catch early-morning flights. On early flights, people are usually happy to stay under the radar, read a book, quietly sip a coffee while staring out the window, or just solidly gaze into the back of their eyelids with their mouth open while heavy breathing.Recently I took an early flight with my mate Dan. He quickly locked into the last option. I\u2019d just downloaded Bob Goff\u2019s latest book \u2018Everybody Always\u2019 to my Kindle, so I opened that and nestled in for a quiet \u2018Option 2\u2019.Bob\u2019s book is all about loving everybody, always\u200a\u2014\u200aand this particular chapter was talking about loving our neighbours and encouraging them on the journey of faith. Not just our literal next-door neighbours, but that we actually find neighbours everywhere. In our workplace, our cafes, yoga-classes and, you guessed it, next to us on planes.I quickly glanced at the guy next to me; my current neighbour. He was probably pushing 60, looked like he\u2019d seen the sun most days of his life and was reading some fiction book about CIA spy missions. Now I\u2019ve got a pretty high threshold for social awkwardness. I don\u2019t usually mind putting myself out there. But, I questioned, \u201cwas I really meant to interrupt this guy? How was I meant to do that? And what if he really was ex-CIA? I wasn\u2019t ready for a painful death.\u201d>_I thought to myself\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cWell, if God\u2019s plan is to use me, then I\u2019m going to put it back on Him to get me in/out of this scenario.\u201d So, that\u2019s what I did._I just honestly said \u201cLook Jesus, I don\u2019t really care if I talk to this guy or not, but if you want me to, can you get him to put down his CIA spy manual and talk to me? And also, can he please not kill me in a painful way? k.thanks.bye.\u201dThen I put my book away and just sat there waiting. 5 mins later he gets a coffee, puts his book down and says, \u201cSo, what do you do for a biscuit?\u201d \u2026Ha!It turned out he wasn\u2019t ex-CIA, he was an awesome guy; a retired teacher. He was visiting his son (who was moving to my city\u2014 another potential neighbour!) and he was super happy and open to chat. As we talked I couldn\u2019t quite see how I was going to steer the conversation \u201cspiritually,\u201d so I just decided to enjoy the conversation and look for an opportunity.The plane was coming down to land, and that opportunity hadn\u2019t come yet. I didn\u2019t want to awkwardly bring \u2018it\u2019 up out of nowhere so, instead I casually pointed out that it was raining outside.My neighbour, let\u2019s call him \u2018old mate\u2019, replied with this\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny, you can water your garden with the hose as much as you like, but if the same amount of rain falls on it, it just seems to flourish.\u201d There it was! My opportunity! So, I took it!>_I simply opened my mouth and shared what I thought about rain from a spiritual perspective._\u201cWell, from my perspective, that\u2019s God. If God created the world, why wouldn\u2019t the rain that he created be the thing that makes it flourish in the best way.\u201d I said.He replied, \u201cYeah I guess. I\u2019m not that religious though. I went to a catholic church when I grew up but haven\u2019t gone back for years.\u201dI smiled on the inside as I knew I had turned a conversation to God and said: \u201cYeah I grew up in a religious church too. It wasn\u2019t until I started reading the Bible and thinking \u2018If Jesus really existed, if this is really true, this could actually change my life.\u201dThe conversation went on. It wasn\u2019t awkward. I didn\u2019t Bible bash him. I didn\u2019t lead him in the \u2018sinners prayer\u2019. I simply opened my mouth and shared my thoughts and asked what his were.I am a fairly normal guy. I don\u2019t consider myself an evangelist and turning conversations towards God isn\u2019t something I do every day (yet). But, it definitely was exciting to see God throw me an opportunity and it was fun to step up and take it.I took up Jesus\u2019 invitation to join Him in the great co-mission, of restoring humanity to Him. I invited the Holy Spirit to guide me and then obeyed His promptings.I have no idea what \u2018old mate\u2019 is thinking now about our conversation. I\u2019m just praying that the conversation we had was a seed that would grow in some way."

Our love and our desire to become like Jesus and follow His teachings makes us countercultural and makes us different. It is that difference that allows us to push against the \u2018me centred\u2019 and\u00a0feelings-based mentalities\u00a0which control society. Mentalities which are results of miss informed identity. An identity void of Christ. Our faith allows us to showcase a grace filled, selfless view of the world from a strong place of identity and purpose rooted in Christ. It is from this place that we have the greatest opportunity to point people to an encounter with Jesus, no matter the complexity of the current social climate, because we know we are saved (identity) and called (purpose) and we know who we are and whose we are.How we love and how we live ought invite others to also believe what we believe."

        "title": "FAQ: Does God Still Heal Today?",
        "body": "Does God still heal today? Absolutely, and it\u2019s time to see more! Have you ever considered putting yourself in the shoes of a person that has just got healed?Imagine you got instantly cured of an incurable disease, what about a lingering sickness that was suddenly gone, or you had a physical transformation in your body\u200a\u2014\u200ayou were blind but now you can see, or you were paralysed and now you\u2019re not. Would you want to connect to the power that healed you? I know I would!If you need a healing today or know someone close to you who does, I have very good news for you\u2026 \u201cJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aHebrews 13:8.That means the same healing power that changed lives 2,000 years ago is available to us today.Mark 16:17\u201318 tells us:_\u201cThese signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.\u201d_There are many other scriptures in the Bible that talk about healing. Some that immediately come to mind are\u2026**John 14:12\u201314\u200a\u2014\u200aVery truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.****Matthew 28:18\u201320\u200a\u2014\u200aThen Jesus came to them and said, \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.****Matthew 10:8\u200a\u2014\u200aHeal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.**There are amazing testimonies of healing today, and there are many more to come. Have you allowed yourself to entertain the thought that you can be used by God to see others healed?We simply need to believe what Jesus has commanded us to do. Step out in the authority God has given us, ask in faith for people to be healed and expect to see miracles.Praying for healing is a great way to raise intrigue in people who don\u2019t know Jesus. What better way to be introduced to Jesus than through a miracle!"

        "title": "How I Learnt to Share My Faith Daily - Sarah\u2019s Story",
        "body": "I recently spoke with Sarah, a young woman who shares her faith daily online. 18 months ago she had never lead anyone to Christ, but it\u2019s almost a weekly occurrence.She has gone from being nervous to share anything about Jesus, to someone who takes a conversation about Him without a second thought.**What happened? Here\u2019s what she said:**\u201cAt the beginning, sharing your faith can be daunting and fear can stop you from jumping in with boldness. However, the more you practice the more confident you become. There are many things personally that can hold you back, but when you allow Jesus to work in your life, you can transform this world into His Kingdom.When I first started my journey in sharing my faith it did not go as easily as I thought. But that didn\u2019t stop me. I grew in my confidence by just doing it! I jumped into the deep end and learned through action._I\u2019ve learned to be confident knowing that Jesus always had my\u00a0back._I found that the more I trusted the Holy Spirit and His promptings, the more fun and freedom I had. I become more confident to step out into deeper waters. With every hard question or series of harsh words in a conversation, I would remember Jesus\u2019 unconditional love for me which would remind me that Jesus loves this person in the same way._The more I saw people as Jesus saw them, the less fear took over and the more confident I became in sharing my faith. I knew that people need Jesus as much as I\u00a0do._I always think back to my life without Jesus, or a time that I was struggling and needed Him more than ever. That would remind me that there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus.My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014_\u200a\u201cHe must become greater; I must become less\u201d.__When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don\u2019t know\u00a0Jesus._The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus\u2019 love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.> Don\u2019t be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It has been one of my biggest learning curves but it\u2019s been one of my\u00a0best.**Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\u201d**"

I went with that little Holy Spirit nudge to keep reaching out. I\u2019m so glad I did \u2026Rahul* was suspicious yet curious enough to say hi. He knew God, he grew up knowing God was there, and knowing about Jesus. God had control of his life, or so he thought...He didn\u2019t have a Bible and was suspicious of any online Bible links I was trying to send him, so I called a local church and made arrangements so he could collect one from the church office and, then I prayed for him.Rahul wasn\u2019t connected to a church and didn\u2019t want to be.

Now my life is messed up n I\u2019m carrying on right or wrong n I feel like I can\u2019t talk to him to protect me in the wrong things I do\u201d.As we chatted more, I asked if he had ever invited God\u2019s spirit to live inside of him. His answer was \u201cno\u201d.My response: \u201cOh Rahul, you will notice so much difference if you tell God you want him living inside of you. He will change and rock your world in a way that you have never known before. When you have the spirit of God living inside of you his truth permeates every part of your being, he guides you, he speaks to you, he directs you, he gives you strength even when you are weak. Do you think you would like to ask God to come into your life, to tell him you are sorry you\u2019ve tried living life without him and ask him to be your boss?\u201dHis answer was \u201cyes\u201d and as a result, I lead him in a prayer to do just that.Rahul\u2019s comment afterwards was \u201cI felt like my spirit jumped out when saying this prayer n I\u2019m a grown man but for me to cry like that I know this prayer is powerful\u201d.I started to chat to him about church again, and talk through what would work for him as he\u2019s very shy.

It\u2019s a whole new journey for him now he\u2019s given God control and asking Jesus to be boss of his life.Be sensitive to pursue conversation a little further. It all started with an offer to pray. I typed out, and spoke out loud what I prayed. When Rahul hadn\u2019t done what he said he would do I followed him up, and simply asked a question; \u201care you ok?\u201d. It\u2019s amazing what a simple question can do.Sometimes we can feel like we are spamming our friends, being annoying, or overdoing it. *Is there someone you need to \u2018stick with\u2019 until the breakthrough comes?*"

I often think about what will my brief time here on earth will be measured by.You can find that blog HERE.Often, we have a great desire to implement change in the world, and I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m no exception to the rule. We\u2019re idealistic and have a strong sense of justice. Our dream job often features working in or starting a social enterprise, where we can right the world\u2019s wrongs\u200a\u2014\u200aand get paid for it. Or maybe that\u2019s just me.At the end of the day when all is said and done, and we stand before the Master who gave us life, what will He say? Of our deeds, words, victories and failures\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat will be of noteworthiness to God? Of course the atoning sacrifice of Jesus wipes away the stains of our sin and error. So there\u2019s no condemnation here.My question is what is left standing after this cleansing, and what will be its eternal significance? Did it build God\u2019s Kingdom or our own?What about the person we have become? The Bible constantly reminds us to \u2018live worthy of our calling\u2019 so to speak, and the Holy Spirit has been sent as the Helper to grow us into disciples (people who walk and talk like Jesus). In the letter of Jude we know God\u2019s goal is to make us Christ-like, and present us to Himself without fault in that final day (Jude 1:24).So how can we know this is process is actually taking place in our own lives? Well, we judge a tree by it\u2019s fruit, and the first fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. So in short; if we really know God, the fruit will look like Christ\u2019s love working though us. How can we outwork this great love? One way is by sharing the greatest gift we\u2019ve been given\u200a\u2014\u200athe Good News of Jesus in word and deed.Love is the measuring stick of our lives. At the end of our days, I would submit to you that the summation of all our work, our relationships and our lives on which we\u2019re to be commended on will be this: Did we love well?Do you pass the Love Test?

That would remind me there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus for themselves.My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHe must become greater; I must become less\u201d.> When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don\u2019t know\u00a0Jesus.The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus\u2019 love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.Don\u2019t be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It\u2019s has been one of my biggest learning curves but it\u2019s been one of my best.Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\u201d"

        "title": "What Can We Learn From Billy Graham?",
        "body": "Are you believing for a spiritual awakening? Are you believing for lives around you to be changed with the truth of the Gospel?Billy Graham was a man who believed that. He is known as the worlds greatest evangelist. It is certainly worth listening to what he had to say about a spiritual awakening and ask the question \u201cwhat can I learn from his life?\u201dSoon after his 99th Birthday in 2017, a video was released (see below) about his entry into his 100th year (Sadly, in February 2018, Billy passed away). Something that Larry King said in the video is worth taking note of. It was the way he recalled spending time with Billy, he said it with with fluency and using his fingers to recount:> \u201cHe answered the questions but it always came back to; Christ is your Saviour. Christ loves you. Christ is with me.\u201dLarry, a man that doesn\u2019t follow God was able to recount 3 things about Billy\u2019s words that in and of themselves are the Gospel.The video gives a fantastic summary, here\u2019s a transcript from \u201cReflections of the Christian Life\u201d, this is what Billy had to say:\u201cI\u2019ve been praying that we might have a spiritual Awakening but I think that becomes possible only as individuals surrender their lives afresh and anew to Christ and live the Christian life wherever you are.First\u00a0we do everything we can to follow in the steps of Jesus.We\u2019re to live a life in which we love one another. We help one another. We live according to what Jesus lived. The Holy Spirit is the one that helps us live that new life style which is one of; love, gentleness and patience, and all of these things that are the fruit of the Spirit.> We must remember that we communicate the gospel by our lives as well as our\u00a0lips.We live before a watching world, a world that is waiting to see if what we say is lived out in our lives. We must be living in the power of the Spirit. We must be men and women that are pure vessels for God\u2019s message.Secondly\u00a0you read His word everyday, the Bible. I know it\u2019s very difficult but you need to start somewhere and I suggest that you start with the gospel of Luke in the New Testament and in the Old Testament with the very first verse. \u201cIn the beginning God..\u201d and study those passages.Make the Bible your source and authority, quote it frequently. Let it\u2019s message be your message. Study it. Meditate on it, trust it\u2019s promises. The Word of God itself has power.Thirdly\u00a0go to your knees and pray until you and God have become intimate friends. I cannot describe to you the joy and the peace that He give to you as a result of that daily routine that you have in prayer.Is there a lack of power in your life?\u00a0Perhaps you have neglected the preparation of your life with neglected prayer. We\u2019ve neglected God\u2019s word and the feeding of our own souls. Whatever it is, confess it, forsake it, repent of it, and then walk in the power of the Holy Spirit and gain victory over it. And may God today lift our vision and may the power of the Gospel break upon our world with fresh force, as we are obedient to Christ\u2019s call to repent and believe the Gospel. Repent and believe the gospel!\u201dWow, what a message! Will you take up the challenge today? Are you willing to be a vessel God uses for a spiritual awakening?##### Here are 3 things to do to take up the challenge\u20261. Ask God to reveal any lack of power in your life  Are you living out what Jesus lived? Ask God today to reveal any area of your life where your words don\u2019t match your actions and put it right \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc2. Make reading your Bible a daily habit  Spend time daily reading the Bible, you don\u2019t leave the house without clothes. Make it your goal not to leave the house without reading your Bible \ud83d\udcd63. Make it your goal to become intimate friends with God\u00a0  Spend time daily talking with God, get to know Him intimately \ud83d\ude03"

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Write My Testimony?",
        "body": "Whether you\u2019re a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and we are here to help you write yours!Let\u2019s get to it!##### What is a Testimony?In a Court of law, a testimony is a formal written or spoken statement which gives evidence or proof of an experience. As a Christian, your testimony is similar, however not formal. Your testimony is an account of what God has done in your life and how you came to know and follow Him through those experiences. Your testimony is your God story.In\u00a0[Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A8&version=NIV)\u00a0in the Bible, Jesus tells us \u201cY_ou will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses._\u201d Sharing your testimony is the perfect way to be a witness.> Sharing personal experiences of how Jesus transformed your life will always have greater impact than an impersonal blanket statement of\u00a0faith.A good testimony should explain:- WHAT your life was like BEFORE you decided to follow Jesus.- WHY you decided to follow Jesus.- HOW your life has changed AFTER following Jesus.#### 8 Essential Steps to Writing Your Testimony##### Step 01\u200a\u2014\u200aPause And Ask God To Help\u00a0YouIt may seem obvious but the truth is, we often forget to pray. So, take a moment to pause and ask the Holy Spirit \u201c_What aspect of my life do you want me to share?_\u201d Chances are, you may already have an idea about what you want to write, but take the time to ask Him first. He may have something specific.##### Step 02\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life Before Following JesusDescribe what your life was like before you decided to follow Jesus. This sets up your story. Write a paragraph or two. No need to go any longer than 300 words. Confidently detail your thoughts and emotions at the time.Answer questions like:- What was my life truly like? (Lonely, Empty, Shallow, etc)- What did my life revolve around the most?(Work, A partner, Alcohol, etc)- What did I get my security or happiness from? (Success, Possessions, etc)- How did those areas begin to let me down?##### Step 03\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe When And Why You Chose To Follow\u00a0JesusSimply write a paragraph or two (300 words) explaining why you chose to explore life with Jesus.Answer questions like:- When was the first time I heard the Gospel or about Jesus?- What were my initial reactions?- When did my attitude begin to change? Why?- What were the final struggles that went through my mind before I accepted Jesus?- Why did I go ahead and accept Jesus?##### Step 04\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life After Following JesusThis is where you can begin to join the dots and bring closure to your testimony. Talk about how this experience has shaped or changed you.Write a sentence or two on each of these points:- How has this experience changed your perspective of God and life?- Describe how this has impacted the way you live, feel and think.- How has this story changed the way you relate to and understand God?- This is the most impacting part, because now you\u2019re presenting a view of God based on things that really happened to you.##### Step 05\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your Language\u00a0SimpleIt is best to avoid using \u201cChristian\u201d language that people unfamiliar with Christianity wouldn\u2019t understand. Use normal every-day language.\u201cChristians routinely use words like sin, salvation, fellowship, sanctification, and the Gospel without realising these phrases can leave their friends confused or even repelled.\u201d> \u200a\u2014\u200aLuke CawleyIf you find yourself using words like this, try and replace them with commonly used phrases. Rather than using a phrase like \u2018my sins are washed by the blood\u2019, try say something like \u2018Jesus has forgiven the things I did wrong, and has given me a fresh start\u2019. It\u2019s not to say the first isn\u2019t true, but people are simply not familiar with that language.##### Step 06\u200a\u2014\u200aGet\u00a0FeedbackGive a copy to a Christian friend, and get their feedback. Ask them if they think there is anything you could add or change to make your testimony stronger. Better yet, read it out loud to them. Often things written down sound different when they are spoken out.##### Step 07\u200a\u2014\u200aMemorise The Key\u00a0PointsYou want to be able to tell your story without reading it. It is your story, so it should be easy to do. Write down the key aspects of your story (including events, thoughts, feelings) in sequential order, and list them in bullet points. These will be easier to memorise and enable you to tell your testimony more naturally.##### Step 08\u200a\u2014\u200aShare Your TestimonyNow you have your finished writing your testimony, it\u2019s time to share it with someone. Get out there, give it a go! Practise makes perfect. Give yourself some grace, have fun and begin to get comfy with your story.We believe in you."

We encourage Christians to share their faith, and encourage non-Christians to come to faith. On numerous occasions we\u2019ve spoken with Non-Christians who months later come back to us to ask more questions.A classic example of this is the story of John*\u200a\u2014\u200aIt took him one year to come back and pick up the conversation about God.

(Lonely, Empty, Shallow, etc)\u00b7 Saan umiikot ang mundo ko noon?(Work, A partner, Alcohol, etc)\u00b7 Saan ako nag-aanchor ng security at happiness? (Success, Possessions, Romantic Relationships, etc)\u00b7 How did those areas begin to let me down?**Step 03\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe When And Why You Chose To Follow Jesus**Sumulat ka lang ng isa o dalawang paragraph na nag-eexplain kung bakit mo piniling tanggapin si Jesus sa buhay mo.**Answer questions like:**\u00b7 Kailan ko unang narinig ang Gospel o kailan unang naintroduce sa akin si Jesus?\u00b7 Paano ako nag-react noon?\u00b7 Kailan nag-bago ang pag-uugali ko? Bakit?\u00b7 Anong mga pag-aalinlangan mayroon ako bago ko tanggapin si Jesus?\u00b7 Bakit ko piniling tanggapin si Jesus?**Step 04\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life After Following Jesus**This is where you can begin to join the dots and bring closure to your testimony. I-describe mo lang kung paano ka nabago ng experience na \u2018to.**Write a sentence or two on each of these points:**\u00b7 Paano nag bago ang perspective mo tungkol kay God at sa buhay?\u00b7 Describe how this has impacted the way you live, feel and think.\u00b7 Paano nabago ng storya na\u2019to ang pagkakaintindi mo about kay God?\u00b7 This is the most impacting part, because now you\u2019re presenting a view of God based on things that really happened to you.**Step 05\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your Language Simple**It would be best na iwasan mag-banggit ng mga terms na hindi maiintindihan ng mga friends mo na hindi pa followers ni Christ. Use normal every-day language!_\u201cChristians routinely use words like sin, salvation, fellowship, sanctification, and the Gospel without realising these phrases can leave their friends confused or even repelled.\u201d_**_\u200a\u2014\u200aLuke\u00a0Cawley_**If you find yourself using words like these, try mong i-rephrase and put it in a simpler way na maiintindihan at ma-didigest nila. Rather than using phrase like \u2018my sins are washed by the blood\u2019, try say something like \u2018Jesus has forgiven the things I did wrong, and has given me a fresh start\u2019. The first statement is true but hindi siya magkakaroon ng impact to the people we\u2019re sharing with dahil hindi sila pamilyar sa phrase.\u00a0**Step 06\u200a\u2014\u200aGet Feedback**Ipa-check mo sa Christian friend, and ask their feedback. Itanong mo kung may dapat pa bang baguhin o iimprove ang testimony mo to make it stronger. Better yet, read it out loud to them. Madalas words written down sound different kapag spoken out loud.**Step 07\u200a\u2014\u200aMemorise The Key Points**Siyempre gusto mong mai-share ang story mo nang hindi ito binabasa. Story mo \u2018yan kaya for sure madali na \u2018yan for you. Write down the key aspects of your story (including events, thoughts, feelings) in sequential order, saka mo ilista in bullet points. These will make it easier for you na i-memorize at mai-share ang testimony mo in a more natural way.**Step 08\u200a\u2014\u200aShare Your Testimony**Yay! Ngayon natapos mon ang isulat ang testimony mo, it\u2019s time to share it with someone. Get out there, give it a go! Practice makes perfect. Give yourself some grace, have fun and begin to get comfy with your story.**Naniniwala kami sa\u2019yo.**"

        "body": "## \u201cArthur Stace, a reformed alcoholic and convert to Christianity, spent 37 years writing in chalk on Sydney\u2019s footpaths the one word sermon \u201cEternity\u201d, and he wrote it more than half a million times!He started early, usually before dawn\u00a0,and he wandered through all the streets of Sydney. Every morning he was somewhere else, Wynyard, Glebe, Paddington, Randwick, Central Station. As he said\u200a\u2014\u200awhere God directed him. Every night the message appeared in his head. He was a very little man, bent, grey-haired, only five feet three inches tall and just seven stone. He looked frail enough to blow away. Then with the formality of another generation he always wore a grey felt hat, tie and prim double-breasted navy blue suit. Sometimes in the dawn light he would be seen around Wynyard Station. He would nod to the drunks still left on the pavement and he would look at the debris of the affluent society stretched out on the park benches, trying to keep warm under newspapers. If he detected any movement there would be a pat on the head or a warm greeting. He had the air of a man who understood.As he walked every so often he would stop, pull out a crayon, bend down and write on the pavement in large, elegant copperplate\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cEternity\u201d. He would move on a hundred yards then write it again, \u201cEternity\u201d, nothing more, just one simple word.He did not like publicity. He regarded his unique style of evangelism as a serious mission, something between Arthur Stace and his Maker, so for a decade these Eternity signs mystified Sydney.\u201d\u00a0_(The above is an exert from a book By Keith Dunstan )_Arthur Stace described his life-changing experience at the Burton Street church in an interview with the\u00a0_Daily Telegraph\u00a0_in 1965, two years before his death:John Ridley was a powerful preacher and he shouted, \u2018I wish I could shout Eternity through the streets of Sydney.\u2019 He repeated himself and kept shouting, \u2018Eternity, Eternity\u2019, and his words were ringing through my brain as I left the church. Suddenly I began crying and I felt a powerful call from the Lord to write \u2018Eternity\u2019. I had a piece of chalk in my pocket, and I bent down right there and wrote it. I\u2019ve been writing it at least 50 times a day ever since, and that\u2019s 30 years ago\u00a0\u2026 I think Eternity gets the message across, makes people stop and think.The tag \u201cEternity\u201d is best known to Australians by its prominent display on the Sydney Harbour Bridge during Sydney New Year\u2019s Eve 1999\u20132000, it was also displayed in the opening ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympic Games.The momentum has continued with the \u201cEternity\u201d gallery in the National Museum of Australia, named after Arthur Stace. The thought behind \u2018Eternity\u2019 is suggestive of the timelessness of stories, and embodies the message that all people have a story to tell, with one word or with many.\u201cEternity\u201d is also a newspaper published in Australia by the Bible Society, with content covering: personal testimonies, missionary news, book excerpts, social justice, and perspectives on popular culture\u2026..and you guessed it\u2026.named after Arthur Stace, and there are many others also.> _Arthur Stace didn\u2019t look for a name or for prominence, he was concerned for one thing, to do what his heavenly Father directed him to\u00a0do._Many of us will not receive a name or prominence here on earth, but what we do will effect eternity for both ourselves and others.[Matthew 16: 24\u201325](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A+24-25&version=NIV)\u00a0shows us clearly what we are to do as a follower of Jesus.Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cAll who want to come after me must say no to themselves, take up their cross, and follow me. All who want to save their lives will lose them. But all who lose their lives because of me will find them\u201d.Can I encourage you to ask God today, \u201cHow are you directing me, what am I to do?\u201d Everyone\u2019s message will be different, but what message are you sharing?"

        "body": "Being a believer for almost 24 years now, I have been exposed to a lot of culture and Christianity. One thing I have realized (a personal conviction I hold on to) is this: The Word of God must be faithfully preached. Evangelism in preaching the good news of Jesus Christ to the people.Charles Spurgeon, whom I believe was one of the most influential and faithful Gospel preachers in the 19th century, was a self-professed Calvinist (those who believe in predestination and election, more importantly the doctrines of grace) but had a deep burden for souls to be saved.He was not a hyper Calvinist. He didn\u2019t think that there no was use for evangelism because the elect will be saved at one point in their lives and no amount of effort from our end could manipulate that. He really did the work of an evangelist. The professing Calvinists of today who are into the extremes of their beliefs can learn a lot from Spurgeon._Yes, Charles Spurgeon was a Calvinist, but he was very evangelistic._> Evangelism nowadays has certain practices that make it look like the preacher is selling something and you must buy\u00a0it.We celebrate immediately over hundreds of hands being raised or people running towards the altar call and we measure success of evangelistic preachings based on the numbers.> But what kind of Jesus was preached? Was it just all love? Was the wrath of God even mentioned? Was the Gospel faithfully preached?Charles Spurgeon\u2019s identity was not of a Calvinist, but of a true follower of Christ. He understood the beauty of the Gospel and had a genuine burden for the lost. He spent his entire ministry making sure the Gospel was preached faithfully.\u00a0> There is no need to beautify the Gospel to get the attention of\u00a0people.\u00a0It is beautiful as it is, and the Holy Spirit will do His mighty work to convict the hearts of people who will hear it. We, as followers of our Lord Jesus, need to be faithful in sharing the message of the Gospel, and the hope that it promises to those who believe.------Written by Jeff Lucas"

        "body": "When we received the question: \u201cHow can I live out my faith well in today\u2019s social climate?\u201d I got excited! As a team, we recently read \u2018Good Faith\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aa great book co-written by David Kinnaman & Gabe Lyons leaders of Barna and Q. The premise of the book is: \u201cBeing a Christian when society thinks you\u2019re irrelevant and extreme.\u201d Personally, I highly recommend it. The writers delve into socially hot topics using relevant research and experience to offer practical advice on how to live on mission in a heavily \u2018politically correct\u2019 society.They propose that we can effectively live on mission in todays social climate when we combine the perfect mix of how we love, what we believe and how we live.**How We Love + What We Believe + How We Live = Good Faith**So, to live out our faith well in todays social climate, we need to:Know what we believe and why.Align how we love and live with what we believe.Have conversations which oppose or challenge how we love, what we believe and how we live.Being able to engage in robust discussions with those who may not share the same views as us is important because it helps us examine and build confidence in what it is we believe while also helping others understand._\u201cBy making room for disagreement, you make space for friendship.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aGood Faith_Actually, I wonder if we are truly \u2018loving our neighbour\u2019 and engaging society well if we are only loving those who share the same political views, live in the same areas, enjoy the same music as us, and believe what we believe about God. I wonder if that really is just loving ourselves?>_Real relationships are formed when real conversations happen and real relationships are the perfect foundations for conversations about who Jesus is._As Christians, we need to remember that by following Jesus we will stand in opposition to culture, because what Jesus taught was countercultural. Our love and our desire to become like Jesus and follow His teachings makes us countercultural and makes us different. It is that difference that allows us to push against the \u2018me centred\u2019 and feelings-based mentalities which control society. Mentalities which are results of miss informed identity. An identity void of Christ. Our faith allows us to showcase a grace filled, selfless view of the world from a strong place of identity and purpose rooted in Christ. It is from this place that we have the greatest opportunity to point people to an encounter with Jesus, no matter the complexity of the current social climate, because we know we are saved (identity) and called (purpose) and we know who we are and whose we are.How we love and how we live ought invite others to also believe what we believe."

Whatever the path is, remember this:> Living life on mission doesn\u2019t have to be\u00a0grand.Erick Tota\u00f1es resigned from the corporate life after 15 years because God called him to do full-time ministry.

When things started to become stable and consistent, God impressed in his heart to do independent church planting. Despite the offer to have a pastoral position in another church, God\u2019s calling for him was clear: start a church plant.BASIC Church was born out of this obedience, and it was launched last December 2016.

When we struggle or when we sin, we can be open and honest without the fear of getting judged\u200a\u2014\u200aplus people get to pray with and for us!Darwin\u2019s story shows how accountability played a great part in his walk with the Lord:_I knew Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior when the Gospel was shared to me in Sunday school. When I entered college, I was overwhelmed with the freedom that I had and met a lot of new friends. Despite being part of a Dgroup (Discipleship Group), I got influenced to start partying, drinking, smoking, and flirting with the opposite sex. I also got involved in a relationship that did not honor God.__Because of my poor choices and grades I almost got kicked out of school. It was God\u2019s wake up call for me to go back to Him. My sister also encouraged me to seek God again. I appealed to the school administrator and by God\u2019s grace, I was re-admitted. From then, I committed to focus on my studies and change my lifestyle.__I started serving in our youth worship services, got actively involved in our Dgroup and eventually started leading my own. However, my lack of accountability I entered into another relationship which led to sexual immorality. I thought I could hide my sin but it affected my service to God and the men I was leading.__Eventually God convicted me to open up to my Dgroup leader and my disciples. Some stopped attending my Dgroup. I did not have peace. I felt hopeless because I was just sinning and confessing repeatedly. Eventually, I stepped down from my ministries and broke off the relationship.__But after two years, I had three immoral relationships at the same time. In time, my sin was revealed and exposed to my batchmates. My image as the guy who\u2019d share God\u2019s word was tainted. It was at that time that I truly repented from my sins and accepted the consequences of my actions.__When my Dgroup leader learned about what happened, he listened to my entire story and showed his love and care for me. He spoke the truth in love and never felt any condemnation. From that time on, I became accountable by being honest with my struggles, and taking actions on things that I would just ignore before. He\u2019d constantly check and pray for me. My Dgroup leader helped me go back to the Lord and restore my relationship with Him. The Holy Spirit also came in power, opened my eyes, and gave me the hunger to read the Bible and pray.__I started opening up to my parents too and asked forgiveness from the people that I hurt. I got back to serving in the ministry again and began to intentionally disciple male students.__After graduating from college, God led me to serve in campuses as volunteer where I saw the needs of the students for Jesus. Today, I am serving as CCF Campus Missionary and the Lord has entrusted college and senior high students in Ortigas areas for me to disciple and mentor. It has been a great privilege for me to be part of the Lord\u2019s work in the lives of these students because I do not want them to experience what I had gone through._You might be dealing with your struggles on your own, but you don\u2019t have to.

Here\u2019s what she said:**\u201cAt the beginning, sharing your faith can be daunting and fear can stop you from jumping in with boldness. however, like everything, the more you practice the more confident you become. There are many things personally that can hold you back, but when you allow Jesus to work in your life, you can transform this world into His Kingdom.When I first started my journey in sharing my faith it did not go as easily as I thought. But that didn\u2019t stop me. I grew in my confidence by just doing it! I jumped into the deep end and I learnt through action.The biggest part of me learning to be confident was learning that Jesus always had my back and He was wanting me to give it a go.I found the more I leant on trusting the Holy Spirit and His promptings, the more fun and freedom I had. I become more confident to step out into deeper waters. With every hard question or series of harsh words in a conversation, I would remember Jesus\u2019 unconditional love for me which would remind me that Jesus loves this person in the same way.>_The more I saw people as Jesus saw them, the less fear took over and the more confident I became in sharing my faith. I knew that people need Jesus as much as I do._I always think back to life without Jesus, or a time that I was struggling where I needed Him more than ever. That would remind me there are so many people who are needing the same hope and peace I found in Jesus for themselves.My confidence to take the leap to share my faith came by knowing that what I was doing was not in my own strength, but by the power of God that I had in me. Like it says in John 3:30\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cHe must become greater; I must become less\u201d.>_When we allow Jesus to work in us, we will step into boldness and become more attractive to those who don\u2019t know Jesus._The closer we are to Jesus the more we will radiate His light, and people will want to gravitate toward us. They may react to Jesus\u2019 love in unusual ways, but do not fear or stop! The more you step into your identity in Christ nothing will hold you back because you are the beloved child of God. Do not forget that Jesus has died for you and that the person next to you needs to know that too.Jesus is just asking us to reach out and use our voice to speak His truth and to love people how He loves us.Don\u2019t be afraid to get out of the boat and have fun getting wet. The deeper you go the more confident you will become. It\u2019s has been one of my biggest learning curves but it\u2019s been one of my best.**Saving people through Jesus should be our greatest gift to the world.\u201d**"

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Write My Testimony?",
        "body": "Whether you\u2019re a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and we are here to help you write yours!Let\u2019s get to it!**What is a Testimony?**In a Court of law, a testimony is a formal written or spoken statement which gives evidence or proof of an experience. As a Christian, your testimony is similar, however not formal. Your testimony is an account of what God has done in your life and how you came to know and follow Him through those experiences. Your testimony is your God story.In Acts 1:8 in the Bible, Jesus tells us \u201cYou will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses.\u201d Sharing your testimony is the perfect way to be a witness.>_Sharing personal experiences of how Jesus transformed your life will always have greater impact than an impersonal blanket statement of faith._**A good testimony should explain:**1. WHAT your life was like BEFORE you decided to follow Jesus.2. WHY you decided to follow Jesus.3. HOW your life has changed AFTER following Jesus.####8 Essential Steps to Writing Your Testimony**Step 01\u200a\u2014\u200aPause And Ask God To Help You**It may seem obvious but the truth is, we often forget to pray. So, take a moment to pause and ask the Holy Spirit \u201cWhat aspect of my life do you want me to share?\u201d Chances are, you may already have an idea about what you want to write, but take the time to ask Him first. He may have something specific.**Step 02\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life Before Following Jesus**Describe what your life was like before you decided to follow Jesus. This sets up your story. Write a paragraph or two. No need to go any longer than 300 words. Confidently detail your thoughts and emotions at the time.Answer questions like:1. What was my life truly like? (Lonely, Empty, Shallow, etc)2. What did my life revolve around the most?(Work, A partner, Alcohol, etc)3. What did I get my security or happiness from? (Success, Possessions, etc)4. How did those areas begin to let me down?**Step 03\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe When And Why You Chose To Follow Jesus**Simply write a paragraph or two (300 words) explaining why you chose to explore life with Jesus.**Answer questions like:**1. When was the first time I heard the Gospel or about Jesus?2. What were my initial reactions?3. When did my attitude begin to change? Why?4. What were the final struggles that went through my mind before I accepted Jesus?5. Why did I go ahead and accept Jesus?**Step 04\u200a\u2014\u200aDescribe Life After Following Jesus**This is where you can begin to join the dots and bring closure to your testimony. Talk about how this experience has shaped or changed you.**Write a sentence or two on each of these points:**1. How has this experience changed your perspective of God and life?2. Describe how this has impacted the way you live, feel and think.3. How has this story changed the way you relate to and understand God?4. This is the most impacting part, because now you\u2019re presenting a view of God based on things that really happened to you.**Step 05\u200a\u2014\u200aKeep Your Language Simple**It is best to avoid using \u201cChristian\u201d language that people unfamiliar with Christianity wouldn\u2019t understand. Use normal every-day language.\u201cChristians routinely use words like sin, salvation, fellowship, sanctification, and the Gospel without realising these phrases can leave their friends confused or even repelled.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aLuke CawleyIf you find yourself using words like this, try and replace them with commonly used phrases. Rather than using a phrase like \u2018my sins are washed by the blood\u2019, try say something like \u2018Jesus has forgiven the things I did wrong, and has given me a fresh start\u2019. It\u2019s not to say the first isn\u2019t true, but people are simply not familiar with that language.**Step 06\u200a\u2014\u200aGet Feedback**Give a copy to a Christian friend, and get their feedback. Ask them if they think there is anything you could add or change to make your testimony stronger. Better yet, read it out loud to them. Often things written down sound different when they are spoken out.**Step 07\u200a\u2014\u200aMemorise The Key Points**You want to be able to tell your story without reading it. It is your story, so it should be easy to do. Write down the key aspects of your story (including events, thoughts, feelings) in sequential order, and list them in bullet points. These will be easier to memorise and enable you to tell your testimony more naturally.**Step 08\u200a\u2014\u200aShare Your Testimony**Now you have your finished writing your testimony, it\u2019s time to share it with someone. Get out there, give it a go! Practise makes perfect. Give yourself some grace, have fun and begin to get comfy with your story.We believe in you."

As such, Enzo thought he\u2019d mix the two together and get the best of both worlds.> He grew more and more curious and searched for online content about God, eventually stumbling upon a yesHEis YouTube ad which lead him to download the yesHEis app. After watching a few videos, Enzo found out that he could ask questions in the app as well. So he started asking questions.> This was in September 2017.> Our team rigorously responded to every question for months. The conversations eventually continued from the app to text messages. However, eventually, Enzo stopped messaging.> We heard nothing for months, until July 2018.> Suddenly, we received a text from Enzo. He had reached out to thank the yesHEis team for the support with his journey in finding out more about the Christian faith. He gave the news that he had accepted Christ as his Lord and Saviour and couldn\u2019t be happier!> Please thank God for Enzo and his journey and pray for more and more people to grow curious for Christ.What an encouraging story!A great reminder to keep praying for and reaching out to those who may seem cold toward faith, and a great reminder that some people take time to process faith."

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Simply Explain The Gospel?",
        "body": "\u2018The Gospel\u2019 is a phrase thrown around often in Christian circles. To explain the Gospel, it is important to understand what it is. Let\u2019s unpack it quickly\u2026The word \u2018Gospel\u2019 literally means \u2018Good News\u2019 and it is mentioned 90+ times in the Bible. Broadly speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the whole of scripture; the mega narrative of God\u2019s plan to restore humanity to himself.Specifically speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the good news about Jesus. The story of\u00a0_who\u00a0_He is and\u00a0_what\u00a0_He\u00a0did.##### Let\u2019s break it down so you know how to explain it in 3 simple\u00a0steps\u2026#### 1. God\u2019s\u00a0DesignGod created the world. We can see beauty, purpose and evidence of design all around us. It is impossible to ignore. Just look the intricate design of plants, the way the moon influences the tide, or the ever changing colours in a sunset. The Bible tells us that God originally designed a world that worked perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200awhere everything and everyone fit together in harmony. God created us for a purpose. He created us to know Him and to enjoy Him; to live and bring glory and honour to Him._Read:__\u00a0_[_Genesis 1:31_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A31&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Psalm 19:1_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+19%3A1&version=NIV)_\u00a0&\u00a0_[Ephesians 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10)#### 2. Our Brokenness (Sin)If we look around at society, it is easy to see that humanity is not bringing glory to God. Rather there is a brokenness in the world. We see it in the evil of terrorism, we see it in war, violence, abuse, deceit and betrayal. In ignorance to God, we could search high and low for the reason of the brokenness, but the truth is, beneath it all, the problem is spiritual. Really, we are the problem. We have not lived for God, we have not followed His rules, rather we have made our own. We have not valued a relationship with Him. The Bible calls this sin. Sin is running from God, trying to do life our own way. Sin is taking the title of God and putting it upon ourselves. It is because of sin that we as humanity have become hostile, not only towards God, but towards others. The Bible says the consequence of sin is death._Read:__\u00a0_[_Romans 1:25_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A25&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Romans 3:23_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Romans 6:23_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=NIV)_\u00a0&\u00a0_[_Proverbs 14:12_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+14%3A12&version=NIV)#### 3. The Solution\u00a0(Jesus)Brokenness leads to a place of realising a need for help; a remedy, some Good News. God, because of His mercy and great love for us, did not leave us in our brokenness. He sent His Son, Jesus as a solution to our sin problem. Jesus, came to us, lived a perfect sin-free life (exampling life by God\u2019s design) and willingly chose to die in our place to pay the penalty for our sin. He then defeated death and rose to life. He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Simply hearing this good news is not enough, we must act on it and admit to our sinful brokenness, ask God for forgiveness and stop trusting in ourselves. This is when we can begin to understand God\u2019s original design for our lives and the lives of others._Read:\u00a0_[_John 3:16_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Colossians 2:14_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A14&version=NIV)_,\u00a0_[_Mark 1:15_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1%3A15&version=NKJV)_\u00a0&\u00a0_[_Ephesians 2:8\u20139_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8%E2%80%939&version=NKJV)There you go! A simple (but not too simple that you have to re-explain it) version of the Gospel. Remembering the 3 stages and the key parts of each stage will help you feel confident to share the Gospel at any moment.Why not try explaining the Gospel today?"

She has led many people in the decision to make Jesus their boss, and has prompted many others to take time to explore God more for themselves.I asked Tish to write down a few thoughts from her experiences. You might be surprised to hear what she shares.I\u2019ll let her tell the story\u2026_When I first started chatting to people online I found it really confronting because I got to see the words I was choosing to use. I was shocked at how harsh I was, and at times, I was down right weird! I would read back over the conversation and realise how much of what I was saying was actually distracting the person. To make things worse I noticed that I wasn\u2019t being a good listener\u200a\u2014\u200apeople were opening up and sharing their experiences but instead of acknowledging them, I bull-dozed along with a goal in mind._> I think somewhere in my head I thought if I just got them to say a salvation prayer I had done my\u00a0job._This kind of mentality is dangerous and ineffective. It skips past the part where God is wanting to form a personal relationship with the person. I needed to keep it simple\u200a\u2014\u200amy job was to introduce people to Jesus. After a while, I found I had improved, and talking with people online wasn\u2019t such a hard thing. It got me thinking about the way I spoke though; was I any different when chatting to people face-to-face?__I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve figured out the answer to that question yet, I think it\u2019s a work in progress. I know our words don\u2019t have to be fancy and sound spiritual to make an impact. I know people need to know they can be themselves in front of God and just be real with Him._> I\u2019ve learnt to listen more and I have become less \u2018preachy\u2019 and more relational. People aren\u2019t searching for religion, they are searching for relationship.Whether you are interacting with someone online or face to face; when we are genuine and honest, simple and not fancy, quick to listen and slow to get to the end, we can make a real difference in peoples lives.Why not try out your skills and strike up a conversation with someone online? See how you go with keeping things simple. Allow yourself to read over what you shared and see if God is revealing anything to you about how you chat with the people around you."

        "body": "With the world population at 7.5 billion people, and those that identify as Christian at 2.4 billion, there is still much to be done. Thankfully, the opportunities to share Jesus are endless! Especially online!The Bible has many references, not only to the need for us to share Jesus, but also that people are ready to receive Jesus.\u00a0[2 Corinthians 6:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+6%3A2&version=NKJV)\u00a0says:\u00a0_Now is the favourable time. Now is the day of salvation,\u00a0_and_\u00a0_[Luke 10:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A2&version=NKJV)\u00a0says:\u00a0_The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few._#### Here are 4 practical ways to share Jesus\u00a0online:##### 1. Post Intentional QuestionsWhen Jesus was asked questions, He often responded with a question of His own to arouse curiosity. Whether it was in\u00a0[Matthew 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A15-18&version=NLV)\u00a0with the Pharisees, or the rich young ruler in\u00a0[Mark 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-18&version=NLT), or countless others, Jesus teaches us the power of curiosity. People love to talk and give their opinion. Get them talking about things that matter.The most effective questions are powerful and thought provoking. They are clear, concise, open-ended and invite discussion. When asking questions, wait for the answer don\u2019t provide the answer. God wants to reveal Himself to the world, so ask questions that allow Him to do so.Here are 6 Questions you could ask online:- Why do you think bad things happen?- What would it take for you to believe in God?- What has been your experience of prayer?- What are your thoughts on Jesus?- Have you ever wondered what your purpose was?- Do you have questions about God or faith?##### 2. Offer\u00a0PrayerPeople are open to spiritual things, we just don\u2019t think they are. People are open to conversations about God, they are just waiting for us to start them.Prayer is an awesome way to raise spiritual curiosity in people and a great gateway to spiritual conversations. Every opportunity is an opportunity to offer prayer.##### 3. Share your TestimonyWhether you\u2019re a new Christian or a seasoned Bible scholar, your personal story of becoming a Christian is one of the most powerful ways to share your faith. People love a good story and today is the perfect day to share yours online.Your story matters and your experience matters. They matter because people relate to personal stories and experiences. Share your story & help people understand that Christians are just \u2018broken people made whole through Jesus.\u2019##### 4. Share a\u00a0VideoJesus shared the hope in His heart through stories. He was a master storyteller. In fact, the Bible shows that storytelling was His favorite technique to communicate and reveal truth. Sharing videos is a great way to share the hope in our heart.The message of the Gospel must never change. However, the method/medium by which we spread the Gospel absolutely should. Sharing videos is a great way to share Jesus. Videos help explain what we cannot explain.The\u00a0[yesHEis app](http://www.yesheis.com/)\u00a0is full of videos worth sharing.When it comes to sharing Jesus, your greatest ability is your availability.

This week\u2019s featured video tells a compelling story about a man whose life takes a very drastic turn for the worse after he loses his job. He eventually finds himself lower than he ever imagined he could go; life his left him with no hope for a better future. How do you encourage someone who finds themselves there?\u00a0Telling a friend who is going through a hard season about Jesus can be a very difficult thing to do. The doubt of His existence can be most apparent to a non-believer when times are hard.Here\u2019s a few ways you can be a connector to someone who is going through a tough time:1. **Offer to pray with them.** As obvious this may be, offering to pray with non-believers can be a very intimidating thing but it is still one of the most crucial pillars of our faith. God urges us many times in the Bible to pray for the people around us. He gave prayer to us as a powerful tool to invade this earth with heaven.2. **Check in your friend regularly.** Life as we live it today is probably the most isolating it has ever been. It can be very easy to still feel alone even with all the Facebook friends in the world. Letting your friend know you are there for them during a trial is a very small gesture that can make all the difference.3. **Speak them higher.** When a person\u2019s life takes a knock; their self-confidence usually goes down too. Reminding your friend of who they are and speaking the truth of their identity to them as an overcomer can help to build and reshape their self-image; giving them enough fight to get back up again.4. **Share positivity with them.** It can be a song, a bible verse or even a short video.\u00a0 Getting that text from you can make all the difference. You can start by sharing this week\u2019s featured video with them. Search \u2018Against the Ropes\u2019 on the app to find it."

How do you introduce the subject to your friends?Somehow, we\u2019ve turned our faith into something that doesn\u2019t really get talked about unless we\u2019re \u2018sharing\u2019 it. It\u2019s almost as though the only time we can talk about Jesus to people who aren\u2019t Christians is when we have a purpose or a reason to do so.It\u2019s not wrong to talk about your relationship with God in order to let someone know that they can also know Him, but maybe it would be better to introduce the subject of what you believe in a more relaxed, conversational way.>_Allow your faith in God to be present in your conversation even when you\u2019re not necessarily trying to tell someone about Jesus._If you\u2019re a Christian, talk about it, in everyday conversation! If you were a runner you\u2019d talk to your friends about your running shoes, your training and how you became a runner, even if they weren\u2019t interested in running. Your goal wouldn\u2019t be to make them runners, you\u2019d just be talking about your life. So why not treat your faith in the same way? Do you go to church? Read your Bible? Pray? Talk about it!**Let your friends hear what you believe without any ulterior motives, just as part of who you are.**"

She didn't know what it was that she longed for until one day her life changed.Growing up in a traditional Hindu family, Samatha followed the tenets of Hinduism. She worshiped the deities and followed all the rituals, but still longed for something deeper and more meaningful. It turns out she was longing for a real relationship with God. Her best friend who was a Christian shared Jesus with her.\u00a0_\"I was drawn to my friends faith, and the way she loved others. It was something I had never seen or experienced before and I wanted to have the same joy that she had. She was always so full of it\u00a0!\"_Samatha's search in finding this true joy continued, until one day she ran into two strangers looking for a coffee shop. Little did she know that a random encounter with strangers would lead her to make a life changing decision. That day sitting at this coffee shop she heard the Gospel and of God's love for her and gave her life to Jesus.This was the start to her journey in her faith. Her family however would never approve of her going to church, but didn't stop her from fellowshipping with other believers._\"God knows exactly what you need. I found a house church in the same apartment that I lived in. I was unable to go to church so God got the church to me! I grew in God's word and learnt to depend on the Holy Spirit for wisdom. We now have a small group 'Harvesters' where we learn how to be a true disciple and make disciples for Jesus.There are so many people around us who need to hear what Jesus has done for us and we have to be intentional about it, just the way someone was intentional about sharing it with me.\"_Today a designer by profession Samatha has travelled the world and meets people from different cultures. She trusts the holy spirit to lead her everyday to share her faith no matter where she is. Whether it is with the salesman who sells her fabrics, or the women who work in her boutique. She's always ready when there's an opportunity for her to tell her story and share Jesus with the people in her world."

Ryan tells us about how he went from being just a \u2018church-goer\u2019 to living life, intentionally, with Jesus. With all the busyness that comes with church activity; it can be very easy to get lost in the motions and lose your connection with Jesus.Here are some ways you can maintain your connection with Him even amidst the busyness of life:1. **Prioritise your alone time with Him.** This is, ultimately, the most important time in building your relationship with Him. Going to church and spending time with other believers is still very important but Jesus wants an intimate relationship with each and everyone of us. He wants each and every one of us to know Him; personally.  2. **Pray; continually.** Prayer is essentially having a conversation with Jesus. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. He loves when we talk to Him about every little detail in our life like we would to a friend; that is all that prayer is.  3. **Read the Word.** The Bible tells us to meditate on the word day and night so that we can do what it says. This is how we grow and are transformed by its power.  As we build our life around making time for Him; He will draw closer to us and ultimately transform us into the person He created us to be.

        "title": "FAQ: How Do I Simply Explain The Gospel?",
        "body": "\u2018The Gospel\u2019 is a phrase thrown around often in Christian circles. To explain the Gospel, it is important to understand what it is. Let\u2019s unpack it quickly\u2026The word \u2018Gospel\u2019 literally means \u2018Good News\u2019 and it is mentioned 90+ times in the Bible. Broadly speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the whole of scripture; the mega narrative of God\u2019s plan to restore humanity to himself.>_Specifically speaking, \u2018The Gospel\u2019 is the good news about Jesus. The story of who He is and what He did._Let\u2019s break it down so you know how to explain it in 3 simple steps\u2026####1. God\u2019s DesignGod created the world. We can see beauty, purpose and evidence of design all around us. It is impossible to ignore. Just look the intricate design of plants, the way the moon influences the tide, or the ever changing colours in a sunset. The Bible tells us that God originally designed a world that worked perfectly\u200a\u2014\u200awhere everything and everyone fit together in harmony. God created us for a purpose. He created us to know Him and to enjoy Him; to live and bring glory and honour to Him.**Read: Genesis 1:31, Psalm 19:1 & Ephesians 2:10**####2. Our Brokenness (Sin)If we look around at society, it is easy to see that humanity is not bringing glory to God. Rather there is a brokenness in the world. We see it in the evil of terrorism, we see it in war, violence, abuse, deceit and betrayal. In ignorance to God, we could search high and low for the reason of the brokenness, but the truth is, beneath it all, the problem is spiritual. Really, we are the problem. We have not lived for God, we have not followed His rules, rather we have made our own. We have not valued a relationship with Him. The Bible calls this sin. Sin is running from God, trying to do life our own way. Sin is taking the title of God and putting it upon ourselves. It is because of sin that we as humanity have become hostile, not only towards God, but towards others. The Bible says the consequence of sin is death.**Read: Romans 1:25, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23 & Proverbs 14:12**####3. The Solution (Jesus)Brokenness leads to a place of realising a need for help; a remedy, some Good News. God, because of His mercy and great love for us, did not leave us in our brokenness. He sent His Son, Jesus as a solution to our sin problem. Jesus, came to us, lived a perfect sin-free life (exampling life by God\u2019s design) and willingly chose to die in our place to pay the penalty for our sin. He then defeated death and rose to life. He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Simply hearing this good news is not enough, we must act on it and admit to our sinful brokenness, ask God for forgiveness and stop trusting in ourselves. This is when we can begin to understand God\u2019s original design for our lives and the lives of others.**Read: John 3:16, Colossians 2:14, Mark 1:15 & Ephesians 2:8\u20139**There you go! A simple (but not too simple that you have to re-explain it) version of the Gospel. Remembering the 3 stages and the key parts of each stage will help you feel confident to share the Gospel at any moment.**Why not try explaining the Gospel today?**"

        "title": "Share Jesus Tips: How Do I Live Life On Mission? ",
        "body": "How can a \u2018life on mission\u2019 be defined? Simply, it is walking on a journey with Jesus and sharing that journey with others as you go. Intentionally being a living example of life with Jesus.Romans 12:1\u20132\u00a0(ESV) puts it like this:I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.[b] 2 Do not be conformed to this world,[c] but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don\u2019t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.Committing to a life on mission is all about being intentional in the mundane, about seeing God in the every day moments of life and taking the opportunities given to weave the Gospel into the tapestry of peoples lives and introduce people to Jesus.A life on mission is an adventure. An adventure every Christian should embark\u00a0on.Committing to a life on mission makes sharing your faith easier because sharing your faith becomes a way of life, not a thing you do.Here are a few things to help your life on mission:* \t\tSee the daily-grind as daily opportunities* \t\tListening to the Holy Spirit* \t\tEnsure Bible reading & prayer is a life foundation* \t\tChat with God daily about people and situations, asking Him questions and for direction.Stay \u2018switched on\u2019 to what He is saying in any moment at any time. When God speaks about doing something, talking to someone, acting a certain way, it\u2019s a good idea to obey even when you don\u2019t feel like it."

        "title": "Everyday Bravery",
        "body": "There is a young lady who lives in my neighbourhood. I often see her on my daily commute, also making her way to and from work.She walks with a guide dog and, having talked to her on the odd occasion she needs to be pointed in the right direction, I know she is totally blind. One morning, I stopped for her to cross a zebra crossing. As she strode across the road, oblivious to my gaze, God spoke to me about her everyday bravery.Not that she was exercising a great deal of bravery in that moment. She waited for the prompt from her guide dog that it was safe to proceed. As I halted, the pair then crossed with absent-minded confidence. After all, this was a normal part of her day.> Watching her, I thought of how difficult that task would be for me. If I were to attempt crossing a street, blindfolded, with a guide dog to follow, I would be terrified.I would stumble and fall, scared to trust the dog, with no idea if any cars were coming. The surroundings would feel totally alien to me without sight.I realised that for this young lady, there was a first time to do this. At some stage, she received a new guide dog. She had lessons to learn how to walk with him, read his signals, and trust him. She would have practised with a trainer in a safe area and then eventually ventured onto real streets with a person alongside her for safety. Finally, the day came when it was time for her to go out with her guide dog. Just the two of them. Navigating streets with other pedestrians, children and bikes. Crossing busy roads and finding her own way.I suspect that first day, she needed to muster a great deal of bravery. She would be concentrating, alert, nervous. Just as any of us would be at the first attempt of something new. In fact, she probably felt this way for a while. Maybe there were times it didn\u2019t go smoothly. A beeping car, a sudden bike in her path, a wrong direction. But in pursuit of independence, she pressed on with determination. Until one day she didn\u2019t need all that bravery. One day it was routine. She was confident and relaxed and enjoyed the sun on her face as she walked.> Sometimes, we look at others bravely sharing their faith and we think, I would be terrible at that, I don\u2019t know how they do it with such confidence. I will never get\u00a0there.But just like the young lady, with practise and determination, we can learn. Maybe you get nervous or it has not gone smoothly at times. But with God\u2019s help, it will get easier. It may take a great deal of bravery at first but if you persist, one day you will find you can share with people with confidence, relaxed and enjoying the experience.Taking the first step is simply asking God to help you to be alert to opportunities and to have the right words. Whether it be friends, family or the person sitting next to you on the train.We are all capable of everyday bravery."

You might be surprised to hear what she shares.I\u2019ll let her tell the story\u2026_When I first started chatting to people online I found it really confronting because I got to see the words I was choosing to use. I was shocked at how harsh I was, and at times, I was down right weird! I would read back over the conversation and realise how much of what I was saying was actually distracting the person. To make things worse I noticed that I wasn\u2019t being a good listener\u200a\u2014\u200apeople were opening up and sharing their experiences but instead of acknowledging them, I bull-dozed along with a goal in mind._>_I think somewhere in my head I thought if I just got them to say a salvation prayer I had done my job.__This kind of mentality is dangerous and ineffective. It skips past the part where God is wanting to form a personal relationship with the person. I needed to keep it simple\u200a\u2014\u200amy job was to introduce people to Jesus.

I know our words don\u2019t have to be fancy and sound spiritual to make an impact. I know people need to know they can be themselves in front of God and just be real with Him._>_I\u2019ve learnt to listen more and I have become less \u2018preachy\u2019 and more relational. People aren\u2019t searching for religion, they are searching for relationship._Whether you are interacting with someone online or face to face; when we are genuine and honest, simple and not fancy, quick to listen and slow to get to the end, we can make a real difference in peoples lives.Why not try out your skills and strike up a conversation with someone online? See how you go with keeping things simple. Allow yourself to read over what you shared and see if God is revealing anything to you about how you chat with the people around you."

While some parts of it were spent with family (which I truly valued a lot) other parts were simply about welcoming the \u201cbum life\u201d all over again. I didn\u2019t want to do anything at all. I just wanted to be in my own little cocoon and enjoy being a bum even if it was just temporary. I figured I deserved it because a big part of my day is consumed with long hours on the road and long hours in the office. Rest becomes so valuable so I enjoy vacations.But it made me wonder if as a Christian; am I living my life with a sense of urgency? Is too much rest becoming a hindrance from what I can do more for the kingdom of God?Now don\u2019t get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with rest. In fact, God Himself rested on the seventh day after creating the world in 6 days. Jesus said \u201cCome to me those who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Jesus even slept and rested even during the storm, so rest in itself isn\u2019t wrong. But it should not be an excuse to come into a point of complacency and just chill, relax, and unwind, forgetting what it means to be a Christian for the time being.We all have a limited time on earth. Some live on average of 60\u201370 years, while some die younger. Way younger. And you begin to wonder that life is short.If life is indeed short, what are going to do about it as Christians? What are going to do as carriers of the Gospel that has breathed life into us?Do we share the Gospel to at least one person a day? I\u2019m not saying that it should be a requirement, but I am challenging how we make use of our time. If other people can live intentional lives in sharing the Gospel to others and making a big impact in the kingdom of God, why can\u2019t it be the same for you and me?I believe God always gives us opportunities to share the Gospel to people. Sadly, we do not grab those opportunities most of the time.I do not want Jesus to tell me one day when I meet Him face to face that I didn\u2019t use my time on earth wisely to share the Gospel. If we truly love Jesus and what the Gospel can do to a life of person, we should be passionate in being intentional in exercising our faith every single day of our lives.I have so much to learn, and instead of \u201cEAT. SLEEP. REPEAT.\u201d, I hope my life would become a daily dose of \u201cPRAY. CARE. SHARE.\u201d-------------Written by Jeff Lucas"

Everyone wanted to see more of this new teacher from Nazareth.With such a broad audience, how did Jesus craft His words in such a way get His message through to such a wide variety of people?He told stories [parables]. He was a master storyteller. Jesus knew that everyone loved a good story and He was wise to intertwine what He needed to say through a story.Bishop T.D Jakes recently made an observation about Jesus and culture to the effect of:\u201cIf Jesus had been alive today, He wouldn\u2019t be a carpenter. I think He\u2019d be a film maker.\u201dGreat stories, told in the right way can communicate on a level that surpasses the things that divide us and great storytellers express clearly what the heart previously only felt vaguely.Everyone can tell great God stories because everyone has a story to tell [your testimony] They can be shared in so many forms; Film, music, writing, speaking.
